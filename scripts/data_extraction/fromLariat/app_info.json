Layout: The most common models (orthogonal, layered, force directed) are supported. Composition: Especially for planar graphs, a lot of rules are implemented to derive one graph from another. File import and export: Graphs can be read from Dimacs, Tsplib and Steinlib formats. Layouts can be exported to nearly arbitrary bitmap and vectorial formats by implicit use of the fig2dev and the netpbm packages. Manipulation: Graph incidence structures can be edited and attributes can be assigned to nodes and edges in the graphical front end. While all algorithms are implemented in a C++ class library (libgoblin.a), the editor code and partially the file I/O code are written in the Tcl/Tk scripting language and use a Tcl wrapper of the C++ library.",

Computation of the energy hessian permits prediction of vibrational frequencies, with IR or Raman intensities.

Numerous relativistic computations are available, including infinite order two component scalar corrections, with various spin-orbit coupling options. The Fragment Molecular Orbital method permits use of many of these sophisticated treatments to be used on very large systems, by dividing the computation into small fragments. Nuclear wavefunctions can also be computed, in VSCF, or with explicit treatment of nuclear orbitals by the NEO code.",
