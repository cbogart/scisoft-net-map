## N.B.
 * These instructions where tested on Ubuntu. If on Mac you might need to adopt them for your case (e.g. `brew` instead of `apt-get`)
 * All how-tos can be found in [here](.)

# There are 2 basic use-cases:

1. Get ready with development: `how-to-install`
2. Setup production server on new Ubuntu machine: `how-to-setup-production-server` and `how-to-restart-production`


# And misc use-cases:
Get ready with testing:`how-to-run-tests`, `how-to-setup-pre-commit-hook`
