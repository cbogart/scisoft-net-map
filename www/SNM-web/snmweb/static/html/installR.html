<h1>For R users: How to install scimapClient</h1>

<code>scimapClient</code> anonymously tracks which R packages you use, and sends this information to 
<a href="http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu">http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu</a>,
where you can browse the aggregated results.


<h2>To install</h2>

Type this from your R command line:

<pre>
install.packages("scimapClient", repos="http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu/static/R")
</pre>

After you install it, if you load the package (i.e.  <code>library(scimapClient)</code> ) in the next
few minutes, it will prompt you for permission to do two things: 
<ul>
<li> write to your <code>.RProfile</code> file
(a script that is run automatically every time you start R), and
<li> send anonymized usage packets from your machine, once per session.
</ul>

If you don't happen to load the package right away, or just want to wait and enable it later, you'll
have to enable it manually: type <code>library(scimapClient)</code> to load it, then
<code>enableScimap()</code> to trigger the prompt for permission.

<h2>Source</h2>

Examine the source code on Github: <a href="https://github.com/cbogart/scimapClient">https://github.com/cbogart/scimapClient</a>.
You're free to fork it and modify it, but if you do so, please have it upload usage packets to a different site than
ours (this is set in the "reghost" variable).

<h1>For R package authors: how to instrument your software</h1>

<h2>Simplest way: package-level information only</h2>
Add a dependency to scimapClient to your package, and the line: <code>library(scimapClient)</code>
somewhere in your code, and work with us to make sure
your package is available from the same repositories yours is available from.  It is 
currently available on <code>github.com</code> and on <code>r-forge.com</code>. The users
will not have to do anything special; when they install or use your package, the monitoring
software will come with it, and ask for permission to enable itself.  
We recommend that you make sure your users know about it ahead of time so they know what's
going on: mention it prominently in the package documentation, and let users know that they
can disable tracking later by typing (just one time, at a command line), <code>disableScimap()</code>.

<h1>Technical details for the curious</h1>

The scimapClient package captures the names and version numbers of every package you load during your R
session, and their static dependencies.  When you exit your R session, it bundles these
into an JSON message and sends them by TCP to port 7778 of scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu.  
Here is a sample packet:

<pre>
{ "scimapInfoVersion" : 3,
  "startTime" : "Thu Sep 18 18:36:17 2014",
  "startEpoch" : "1411079777",
  "pkgT" : { "methods/3.1.1" : "utils",
             "datasets/3.1.1" : [ ],
             "utils/3.1.1" : [ ],
             "R/3.1.1" : "utils",
             "grDevices/3.1.1" : [ ],
             "base/3.1.1" : [ ],
             "stats/3.1.1" : [ ],
             "scimapClient/0.1.4" : [ "RJSONIO", "tools" ],
             "graphics/3.1.1" : "grDevices" 
  },
  "jobID" : "16222613839223790698650621411079777",
  "platform" : { "hardware" : "x86_64",
                 "version" : "13.4.0",
                 "system" : "Darwin" },
  "user" : "1622261383922379069865062",
  "weakDeps" : [ ],
  "userMetadata" : [ ],
  "dynDeps" : [ ],
  "weakPackDeps" : [ ],
  "dynPackDeps" : [ ] }
</pre>

You can see a sample packet in your own installation by loading the scimapClient package and typing "previewPacket()" at
the R prompt.

<h3>Meaning of the fields:</h3>
<code>"startTime"</code> and <code>"startEpoch"</code> are the time when your R session started
<p>
<code>"pkgT"</code> shows which packages were used, and what their static dependencies were.
<p>
<code>"user"</code> is a random string of digits generated when you install the package, so that we
can distinguish distinct users.  
<p>
<code>"jobid"</code> is the user number plus the start time of the session,
so we can distinguish distinct sessions.
<p>
<h3>For future use:</h3>
<code>"userMetadata"</code> is a field you can fill (by calling <code>addUserMetadata(list(...))</code> within
your R session).  Currently "write only", since the server stores this information but the web page does not display it.
<p>
<code>"weakDeps"</code>, <code>"dynDeps"</code>, <code>"weakPackDeps"</code>, <code>"dynPackDeps"</code>:
 If the author of an R chose to collect information about
logical dependencies, (sequences of calls to functions of interest), 
these fields would show sequence and nesting relationships between instrumented functions
and the packages they came from.
