<h1>For R users: How to install scimapClient</h1>

<code>scimapClient</code> tracks usage statistics of R packages and displays the
information at <a href="http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu">http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu</a>

<h2>To install</h2>

Type this from your R command line:

<pre>
install.packages("scimapClient", repos="http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu/static/R")
</pre>

Then set your R installation to load the package (i.e.  <code>library(scimapClient)</code> ) in every session.  
The easiest way to do this is to add the following line to a .Rprofile file in your home directory:

<pre>
options(defaultPackages=c(getOption("defaultPackages"),"scimapClient"))
</pre>

<h1>For R package authors: how to instrument your software</h1>

<h2>Simplest way: package-level information only</h2>
Add a dependency to scimapClient to your package, and the line: <code>library(scimapClient)</code>
somewhere in your code, and work with us to make sure
your package is available from the same repositories yours is available from.  The users
will not have to do anything special; when they install or use your package, the monitoring
software will come with it.  We recommend that you make sure your users know about it though;
mention it prominently in the package documentation, and let users know that they
can disable tracking by typing (just one time,
at a command line), <code>disableScimap()</code>.  

<h2>Capturing detailed function-level information</h2>
You can monitor individual functions within your package by calling <code>scimapIn()</code>
at the top of the function, and <code>scimapOut()</code> at the bottom, with no arguments.  
This will capture when one of your functions is calling any other, or in what sequence they're
called. <p>
Do <b>not</b> instrument a function that will be called thousands of times in a session;
this is intended for high-level "main" functions.  It is not resource-intensive, but it
could still slow down a user's processing if these are called millions of times inside a 
loop or a deep recursion.

<h1>Technical details for the curious</h1>

The scimapClient package captures the names and version numbers of every package you load during your R
session, and their static dependencies.  When you exit your R session, it bundles these
into an JSON message and sends them by TCP to port 7778 of scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu.  
Here is a sample packet:

<pre>
{ "scimapInfoVersion" : 3,
  "startTime" : "Thu Sep 18 18:36:17 2014",
  "startEpoch" : "1411079777",
  "pkgT" : { "methods/3.1.1" : "utils",
             "datasets/3.1.1" : [ ],
             "utils/3.1.1" : [ ],
             "R/3.1.1" : "utils",
             "grDevices/3.1.1" : [ ],
             "base/3.1.1" : [ ],
             "stats/3.1.1" : [ ],
             "scimapClient/0.1.4" : [ "RJSONIO", "tools" ],
             "graphics/3.1.1" : "grDevices" 
  },
  "jobID" : "16222613839223790698650621411079777",
  "platform" : { "hardware" : "x86_64",
                 "version" : "13.4.0",
                 "system" : "Darwin" },
  "user" : "1622261383922379069865062",
  "weakDeps" : [ ],
  "userMetadata" : [ ],
  "dynDeps" : [ ],
  "weakPackDeps" : [ ],
  "dynPackDeps" : [ ] }
</pre>

You can see a sample packet in your own installation by loading the scimapClient package and typing "previewPacket()" at
the R prompt.

<h3>Meaning of the fields:</h3>
<code>"startTime"</code> and <code>"startEpoch"</code> are the time when your R session started
<p>
<code>"pkgT"</code> shows which packages were used, and what their static dependencies were.
<p>
<code>"user"</code> is a random string of digits generated when you install the package, so that we
can distinguish distinct users.  
<p>
<code>"jobid"</code> is the user number plus the start time of the session,
so we can distinguish distinct sessions.
<p>
<h3>For future use:</h3>
<code>"userMetadata"</code> is a field you can fill (by calling <code>addUserMetadata(list(...))</code> within
your R session).  Currently "write only", since the server stores this information but the web page does not display it.
<p>
<code>"weakDeps"</code>, <code>"dynDeps"</code>, <code>"weakPackDeps"</code>, <code>"dynPackDeps"</code>:
 If the author of an R chose to collect information about
logical dependencies, (sequences of calls to functions of interest), 
these fields would show sequence and nesting relationships between instrumented functions
and the packages they came from.
