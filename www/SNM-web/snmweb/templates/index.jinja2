    <h1>Scientific Software Network Map</h1>
    <h3>R package data</h3>
    <p>
      The Scientific Software Network Map allows
      interactive exploration of data showing which software
      tools have been used, how use is trending, what applications
      are used together to produce a result, and the publications
      that resulted from that use.
    </p><p>
      Use the menu on the left to browse a sortable list of applications,
      compare usage patterns and trends of chosen applications, find out
      about funding and personnel for this project, and read a
      description of the data source for this demonstration.
    </p><p>
      In the graph shown here, each node represents a single application;
      connections between them indicate that they were used together.
      Solid lines are static dependencies; dotted lines are "logical" dependencies,
      i.e. non-dependent packages used in the same session.
      Line width reflects number of co-occurrences.  
      Node size represents the number of publications associated with projects
      that used the application.
    </p>
