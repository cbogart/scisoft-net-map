    <h1>Scientific Software Network Map</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever tried to understand the interdependencies of different
      applications: what applications work together, how often they interact,
      and what the typical usage patterns are?
    </p>
    <p>
      You can answer these and many more questions using the Scientific
      Software Network Map! Each node represents a single application;
      connections between them indicate that they were used together. Line
      width reflects number of co-occurrences. Node size represents the
      number of publications associated with projects that used the application.
    </p>
    <h2>The diagram is interactive!</h2>
