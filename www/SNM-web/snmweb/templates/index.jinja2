    <h1>Scientific Network Map</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever tried to understand the interdependencies of different
      applications: what applications work together, how often do they interact,
      what are the typical usage patterns?
    </p>
    <p>
      You can answer these and much more questions using Scientific Network Map!
      Each node represents a single application, connections between them indicate
      that they were used together. The size of an application indicates the
      number of runs.
    </p>
    <p>The diagram is interactive!</p>
