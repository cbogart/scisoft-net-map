      <h1>Scientific Network Map</h1>
      <p>
        Have you ever tried to understand the interdependencies of different
        applications: what applications work together, how often do they interact,
        what are the typical usage patterns?
      </p>
      <p>
        You can answer these and much more questions using Scientific Network Map!
        Each node represents a single application, connections between them indicate
        that they were used together. The size of an application indicates the
        number of runs.
      </p>

      <p>The diagram is interactive!</p>
