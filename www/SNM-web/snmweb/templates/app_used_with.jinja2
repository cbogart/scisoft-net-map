      <h2>Application dependencies</h2>
      {%if sci_platform=="R" %}
      Each node represents an R package; the size is how often it was used.
      The size of its pie slice is how often it was run with this app (<i>{{app.title|replace("[dot]",".")}}</i>). 
      A link between nodes shows that these
      packages happened to be loaded at the same time by some script by some user.
      Solid lines indicate static dependencies (i.e. those enforced
      by R's package loading mechanism).  Dotted lines are packages users chose
      to use during the same R session.  

      <h3>Recorded usage</h3>
      The data shows how often R packages were used together by volunteers who are allowing
      us to track their use of R from day to day.
      <br><p>
      (<a name="validity"></a><b>Validity warning</b>: As of March, 2015, the "live usage" data is in its early stages:
         publication data is not yet available for all packages, and usage 
         stats do not contain a large number of use sessions.  So the numbers and relationships
         portrayed here are not representative of overall global usage.
         Github data is drawn from a much larger sample.)
      
      <h3>Github projects</h3>
      The data shows how often R packages were used together in a sample of
      R projects in Github.  We assume that if a package was loaded (as evidenced by
      mention in a DESCRIPTION file or code that uses library() or require()), that its
      dependencies were also loaded.

      Each node represents an application; the size is how often it was run.
      The size of its pie slice is how often it was run with this app ({{app.title|replace("[dot]",".")}}). 
      A dashed arrow between nodes shows that these
      applications happened to be used by the same user on the same day, and that one
      was started after the previous one completed.  For example maybe 
      in order to achieve a goal, a researcher had to run application
      A, then process results with application B; the graph would show an arrow from
      A to B.
