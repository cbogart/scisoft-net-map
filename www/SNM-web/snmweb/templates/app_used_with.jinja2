      Each node represents an R package. A link between nodes shows that these
      packages happened to be loaded at the same time by some script by some user.
      Solid lines indicate static dependencies (i.e. those enforced
      by R's package loading mechanism).  Dotted lines are packages users chose
      to use during the same R session.

      Each node represents an application. A dashed arrow between nodes shows that these
      applications happened to be used by the same user on the same day, and that one
      was started after the previous one completed.  For example maybe 
      in order to achieve a goal, a researcher had to run application
      A, then process results with application B; the graph would show an arrow from
      A to B.
