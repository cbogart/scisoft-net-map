    "abstract": "We address the problem of fracture in homogenous linear elastic thin films using a variational model. We restrict our attention to quasi-static problems assuming that kinetic effects are minimal. We focus on out-of-plane displacement of the film and investigate the effect of bending on fracture. Our analysis is based on a two-dimensional model where the thickness of the film does not need to be resolved. We derive this model through a formal asymptotic analysis. We present numerical simulations in a highly idealized setting for the purpose of verification, as well as more realistic micro-indentation experiments.",

    "abstract": "When a gas perturbed by a laser interference pattern, an optical lattice, exhibits a periodic modulation of its refractive index, strong Bragg diffraction of the perturbing light can occur. This scattering reduces the field's ability to further manipulate the gas. Experimental observations of Bragg scattering, evidence of a two-way coupling, are compared to the evolution of the light fields calculated by solutions to the wave equation. Comparison indicates momentum deposition as a prime contributor to the shape of the scattering function vs. lattice velocity, a rationale further supported through additional direct simulation Monte Carlo simulation.",

    "abstract": "We investigate two strategies to improve the context-dependent deep neural network hidden Markov model (CD-DNN-HMM) in low-resource speech recognition. Although outperforming the conventional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) HMM on various tasks, CD-DNN-HMM acoustic modeling becomes challenging with limited transcribed speech, e.g., less than 10 hours. To resolve this issue, we firstly exploit dropout which prevents overfitting in DNN finetuning and improves model robustness under data sparseness. Then, the effectiveness of multilingual DNN training is evaluated when additional auxiliary languages are available. The hidden layer parameters of the target language are shared and learned over multiple languages. Experiments show that both strategies boost the recognition performance significantly. Combining them results in further reduction in word error rate, achieving 11.6% and 6.2% relative improvement on two limited data conditions.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose several deep neural network architectures that are able to leverage data from multiple languages. Modularity is achieved by training networks for extracting high-level features and for estimating phoneme state posteriors separately, and then combining them for decoding in a hybrid DNN/HMM setup. This approach has been shown to achieve superior performance for single-language systems, and here we demonstrate that feature extractors benefit significantly from being trained as multi-lingual networks with shared hidden representations. We also show that existing mono-lingual networks can be re-used in a modular fashion to achieve a similar level of performance without having to train new networks on multi-lingual data. Furthermore, we investigate in extending these architectures to make use of language-specific acoustic features. Evaluations are per- formed on a low-resource conversational telephone speech transcription task in Vietnamese, while additional data for acoustic model training is provided in Pashto, Tagalog, Turkish, and Cantonese. Improvements of up to 17.4% and 13.8% over mono-lingual GMMs and DNNs, respectively, are obtained.",

    "abstract": "As a feed-forward architecture, the recently proposed maxout networks integrate dropout naturally and show state- of-the-art results on various computer vision datasets. This paper investigates the application of deep maxout networks (DMNs) to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks. Our focus is on the particular advantage of DMNs under low-resource conditions with limited transcribed speech. We extend DMNs to hybrid and bottleneck feature systems, and explore optimal network structures (number of maxout layers, pooling strategy, etc) for both setups. On the newly released Babel corpus, behaviors of DMNs are extensively studied under different levels of data availability. Experiments show that DMNs improve low-resource speech recognition significantly. Moreover, DMNs introduce sparsity to their hidden activations and thus can act as sparse feature extractors.",

    "abstract": "Conventional wisdom in automatic speech recognition asserts that pitch information is not helpful in building speech recognizers for non-tonal languages and contributes only modestly to performance in speech recognizers for tonal languages. To maintain consistency between different systems, pitch is therefore often ignored, trading the slight performance benefits for greater system uniformity/ simplicity. In this paper, we report results that challenge this conventional approach. We present new models of tone that deliver consistent performance improvements for tonal languages (Cantonese, Vietnamese) and even modest improvements for non-tonal languages. Using neural networks for feature integration and fusion, these models achieve significant gains throughout, and provide us with system uniformity and standardization across all languages, tonal and non-tonal.",

Codebook or bag-of-words models have been widely used in text, visual and audio domains and form the state-of-the-art in MED tasks. The overall effectiveness of these models on such datasets depends critically on the choice of low-level features, clustering approach, sampling method, codebook size, weighting schemes and choice of classifier. In this work we empirically evaluate several approaches to model expressive and robust audio codebooks for the task of MED while ensuring compactness. First, we introduce the Large Scale Pooling Features (LSPF) and Stacked Cepstral Features for encoding local temporal information in audio code- books. Second, we discuss several design decisions for generating and representing expressive audio codebooks and show how they scale to large datasets. Third, we apply text based techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to learn acoustic- topics as a means of providing compact representation while maintaining performance. By aggregating these decisions into our model, we obtained 11% relative improvement over our baseline audio systems.",

    "abstract": "Task clustering has been proven to be an effective method to reduce execution overhead and increase the computational granularity of workflow tasks executing on distributed resources. However, a job composed of multiple tasks may have a greater risk of suffering from failures than a job composed of a single task. Our theoretic analysis and simulation results demonstrate that failures can have a significant impact on the runtime performance of workflows that use existing clustering policies that ignore failures. We therefore propose two general failure modeling frameworks (task failure model and job failure model) to address these performance issues. We show the necessity to consider the fault tolerance in the task failure model. Based on the task failure model, we propose three methods to improve the workflow performance in dynamic environments. A simulation-based evaluation is performed and it shows that our approach can improve the workflow makespan significantly for two important applications.",

Task clustering is a runtime optimization technique that merges multiple short workflow tasks into a single job such that the job execution overhead is reduced and the overall runtime performance of the workflow is significantly improved. However, current task clustering strategies fail to consider the imbalance problem of both task runtime and task dependency. In our work, we first investigate the different causes of runtime imbalance and dependency imbalance. We then introduce a series of metrics based on our prior work to measure the severity of runtime and dependency imbalance respectively. Finally, we study a wide range of real scientific workflows to generalize the relationship between these metrics and balancing methods.",

    "abstract": "We carry out high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement simulations of a cool core cluster, resolving the flow from Mpc scales down to pc scales. We do not (yet) include any active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating, focusing instead on cooling in order to understand how gas reaches the supermassive black hole at the center of the cluster. We find that, as the gas cools, the cluster develops a very flat temperature profile, undergoing a cooling catastrophe only in the central 10-100 pc of the cluster. Outside of this region, the flow is smooth, with no local cooling instabilities, and naturally produces very little low-temperature gas (below a few keV), in agreement with observations. The gas cooling in the center of the cluster rapidly forms a thin accretion disk. The amount of cold gas produced at the very center grows rapidly until a reasonable estimate of the resulting AGN heating rate (assuming even a moderate accretion efficiency) would overwhelm cooling. We argue that this naturally produces a thermostat which links the cooling of gas out to 100 kpc with the cold gas accretion in the central 100 pc, potentially closing the loop between cooling and heating. Isotropic heat conduction does not affect the result significantly, but we show that including the potential well of the brightest cluster galaxy is necessary to obtain the correct result. Also, we found that the outcome is sensitive to resolution, requiring very high mass resolution to correctly reproduce the small transition radius.",

    "abstract": "Observations of spiral galaxies show a strong linear correlation between the ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen surface density R mol and midplane pressure. To explain this, we simulate three-dimensional, magnetized turbulence, including simplified treatments of non-equilibrium chemistry and the propagation of dissociating radiation, to follow the formation of H2 from cold atomic gas. The formation timescale for H2 is sufficiently long that equilibrium is not reached within the 20-30 Myr lifetimes of molecular clouds. The equilibrium balance between radiative dissociation and H2 formation on dust grains fails to predict the time-dependent molecular fractions we find. A simple, time-dependent model of H2 formation can reproduce the gross behavior, although turbulent density perturbations increase molecular fractions by a factor of few above it. In contradiction to equilibrium models, radiative dissociation of molecules plays little role in our model for diffuse radiation fields with strengths less than 10 times that of the solar neighborhood, because of the effective self-shielding of H2. The observed correlation of R mol with pressure corresponds to a correlation with local gas density if the effective temperature in the cold neutral medium of galactic disks is roughly constant. We indeed find such a correlation of R mol with density. If we examine the value of R mol in our local models after a free-fall time at their average density, as expected for models of molecular cloud formation by large-scale gravitational instability, our models reproduce the observed correlation over more than an order-of-magnitude range in density.",

    "abstract": "We present an algorithm for simulating the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics and other systems of differential equations on an unstructured set of points represented by sample particles. Local, third-order, least-squares, polynomial interpolations (Moving Least Squares interpolations) are calculated from the field values of neighboring particles to obtain field values and spatial derivatives at the particle position. Field values and particle positions are advanced in time with a second-order predictor-corrector scheme. The particles move with the fluid, so the time step is not limited by the Eulerian Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy condition. Full spatial adaptivity is implemented to ensure the particles fill the computational volume, which gives the algorithm substantial flexibility and power. A target resolution is specified for each point in space, with particles being added and deleted as needed to meet this target. Particle addition and deletion is based on a local void and clump detection algorithm. Dynamic artificial viscosity fields provide stability to the integration. The resulting algorithm provides a robust solution for modeling flows that require Lagrangian or adaptive discretizations to resolve. This paper derives and documents the Phurbas algorithm as implemented in Phurbas version 1.1. A following paper presents the implementation and test problem results.",

A counterpart molecular catalyst that binds to a solid-state substrate would be highly desirable. Here, we report direct observation of single Si adatoms catalyzing the dissociation of carbon atoms from graphene in an aberration-corrected high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The single Si atom provides a catalytic wedge for energetic electrons to chisel off the graphene lattice, atom by atom, while the Si atom itself is not consumed. The products of the chiseling process are atomic-scale features including graphene pores and clean edges. Our experimental observations and first-principles calculations demonstrated the dynamics, stability and selectivity of such a single-atom chisel, which opens up the possibility of fabricating certain stable molecular devices by precise modification of materials at the atomic scale.",

    "abstract": "Stellar feedback drives the circulation of matter from the disk to the halo of galaxies. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a vertical column of the interstellar medium with initial conditions typical of the solar circle in which supernovae drive turbulence and determine the vertical stratification of the medium. The simulations were run using a stable, positivity-preserving scheme for ideal MHD implemented in the FLASH code. We find that the majority (\u224890%) of the mass is contained in thermally stable temperature regimes of cold molecular and atomic gas at T  3 kpc. The magnetic field in our models has no significant impact on the scale heights of gas in each temperature regime; the magnetic tension force is approximately equal to and opposite the magnetic pressure, so the addition of the field does not significantly affect the vertical support of the gas. The addition of a magnetic field does reduce the fraction of gas in the cold (",

    "abstract": "We present an algorithm for simulating the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics and other systems of differential equations on an unstructured set of points represented by sample particles. The particles move with the fluid, so the time step is not limited by the Eulerian Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy condition. Full spatial adaptivity is required to ensure the particles fill the computational volume and gives the algorithm substantial flexibility and power. A target resolution is specified for each point in space, with particles being added and deleted as needed to meet this target. We have parallelized the code by adapting the framework provided by\u2009GADGET-2. A set of standard test problems, including 10\u22126 amplitude linear magnetohydrodynamics waves, magnetized shock tubes, and Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz instabilities is presented. Finally, we demonstrate good agreement with analytic predictions of linear growth rates for magnetorotational instability in a cylindrical geometry.

    "abstract": "The formation of massive stars exceeding 10\u2009M\u2609 usually results in large-scale molecular outflows. Numerical simulations, including ionization, of the formation of such stars show evidence for ionization-driven molecular outflows. Here we examine whether the outflows seen in these models reproduce the observations. We compute synthetic ALMA and CARMA maps of CO emission lines of the outflows, and compare their signatures to existing single-dish and interferometric data. We find that the ionization-driven models can only reproduce weak outflows around high-mass star-forming regions. We argue that expanding H\u2009ii regions probably do not represent the dominant mechanism for driving observed outflows. We suggest instead that observed outflows are driven by the collective action of the outflows from the many lower-mass stars that inevitably form around young massive stars in a cluster.",

    "abstract": "Computational scientists often need to execute large, loosely-coupled parallel applications such as workflows and bags of tasks in order to do their research. These applications are typically composed of many, short-running, serial tasks, which frequently demand large amounts of computation and storage. In order to produce results in a reasonable amount of time, scientists would like to execute these applications using petascale resources. In the past this has been a challenge because petascale systems are not designed to execute such workloads efficiently. In this paper we describe a new approach to executing large, fine-grained workflows on distributed petascale systems. Our solution involves partitioning the workflow into independent subgraphs, and then submitting each subgraph as a self-contained MPI job to the available resources (often remote). We describe how the partitioning and job management has been implemented in the Pegasus Workflow Management System. We also explain how this approach provides an end-to-end solution for challenges related to system architecture, queue policies and priorities, and application reuse and development. Finally, we describe how the system is being used to enable the execution of a very large seismic hazard analysis application on XSEDE resources.",

    "abstract": "Lysine specific demethylase-1 (LSD1/KDM1A) in complex with its corepressor protein CoREST is a promising target for epigenetic drugs. No therapeutic that targets LSD1/CoREST, however, has been reported to date. Recently, extended molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that LSD1/CoREST nanoscale clamp dynamics is regulated by substrate binding and highlighted key hinge points of this large-scale motion as well as the relevance of local residue dynamics. Prompted by the urgent need for new molecular probes and inhibitors to understand LSD1/CoREST interactions with small- molecules, peptides, protein partners, and chromatin, we undertake here a configurational ensemble approach to expand LSD1/CoREST druggability. The independent algorithms FTMap and SiteMap and our newly developed Druggable Site Visualizer (DSV) software tool were used to predict and inspect favorable binding sites. We find that the hinge points revealed by MD simulations at the SANT2/Tower interface, at the SWIRM/AOD interface, and at the AOD/Tower interface are new targets for the discovery of molecular probes to block association of LSD1/CoREST with chromatin or protein partners. A fourth region was also predicted from simulated configurational ensembles and was experimentally validated to have strong binding propensity. The observation that this prediction would be prevented when using only the X-ray structures available (including the X-ray structure bound to the same peptide) underscores the relevance of protein dynamics in protein interactions. A fifth region was highlighted corresponding to a small pocket on the AOD domain. This study sets the basis for future virtual screening campaigns targeting the five novel regions reported herein and for the design of LSD1/ CoREST mutants to probe LSD1/CoREST binding with chromatin and various protein partners.",

    "abstract": "Folates are ubiquitous cofactors that participate in a wide variety of critical biological processes. 5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate and its photodegradation product 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate are both associated with the light-driven DNA repair protein DNA photolyase and its homologues (e.g., cryptochromes). The excited state electronic properties of these folate molecules have been studied here using Stark spectroscopy and complementary quantum calculations. The tetrahydrofolates have relatively large difference dipole moments (ca. 6\u20138 Debye) and difference polarizabilities (ca. 100 \u00c53). This extensive excited state charge redistribution appears to be due largely to the pendant p-aminobenzoic acid group, which helps shuttle charge over the entirety of the molecule. Simple calculations based on the experimental difference dipole moments suggest that tetrahydrofolates should have large two photon cross sections sufficient to enable two photon microscopy to selectively detect and follow folate-containing proteins both in vitro and in vivo.",

This paper offers insights into parameter sweep solutions that support multi-disciplinary science environments via abstraction from resource management complexities using middleware.

    "abstract": "The description of aggregation processes with molecular dynamics simulations is a playground for testing biomolecular force fields, including a new generation of force fields that explicitly describe electronic polarization. In this work, we study a system consisting of 50 glycyl-L-alanine (Gly- Ala) dipeptides in solution with 1001 water molecules. Neutron diffraction experiments have shown that at this concentration, Gly-Ala aggregates into large clusters. However, general-purpose force fields in combination with established water models can fail to correctly describe this aggregation process, highlighting important deficiencies in how solute\u2212solute and solute\u2212solvent interactions are parametrized in these force fields. We found that even for the fully polarizable AMOEBA force field, the degree of association is considerably underestimated. Instead, a fixed point-charge approach based on the newly developed IPolQ scheme [Cerutti et al. J. Phys. Chem. 2013, 117, 2328] allows for the correct modeling of the dipeptide aggregation in aqueous solution. This result should stimulate interest in novel fitting schemes that aim to improve the description of the solvent polarization effect within both explicitly polarizable and fixed point-charge frameworks.",

    "abstract": "We present a method for a subsystem-based calculation of indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling ten- sors within the framework of current-spin-density-functional theory. Our approach is based on the frozen-density embedding scheme within density-functional theory and extends a previously reported subsystem-based approach for the calculation of nuclear magnetic resonance shielding tensors to magnetic fields which couple not only to orbital but also spin degrees of freedom. This leads to a formulation in which the electron density, the induced paramagnetic current, and the induced spin- magnetization density are calculated separately for the individual subsystems. This is particularly useful for the inclusion of environmental effects in the calculation of nuclear spin-spin coupling constants. Neglecting the induced paramagnetic current and spin-magnetization density in the envi- ronment due to the magnetic moments of the coupled nuclei leads to a very efficient method in which the computationally expensive response calculation has to be performed only for the subsystem of interest. We show that this approach leads to very good results for the calculation of solvent-induced shifts of nuclear spin-spin coupling constants in hydrogen-bonded systems. Also for systems with stronger interactions, frozen-density embedding performs remarkably well, given the approximate nature of currently available functionals for the non-additive kinetic energy. As an example we show results for methylmercury halides which exhibit an exceptionally large shift of the one-bond coupling constants between 199Hg and 13C upon coordination of dimethylsulfoxide solvent molecules.",

    "abstract": "The abundance of \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), a natural protein produced by the fetal yolk sac during pregnancy, correlates with lower incidence of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. The pharmacophore region of AFP has been narrowed down to a four amino acid (AA) region in the third domain of the 591 AA peptide. Our computational study focuses on a 4-mer segment consisting of the amino acids threonine-proline-valine-asparagine (TPVN). We have run replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations and used 120 configurational snapshots from the total trajectory as starting configurations for quantum chemical calculations. We optimized structures using semiempirical (PM3, PM6, PM6-D2, PM6-H2, PM6-DH+, PM6-DH2) and density functional methods (TPSS, PBE0, M06-2X). By comparing the accuracy of these methods against RI-MP2 benchmarks, we devised a protocol for calculating the lowest energy conformers of these peptides accurately and efficiently. This protocol screens out high-energy conformers using lower levels of theory and outlines a general method for predicting small peptide structures.",

    "abstract": "The binary H2SO4\u2013H2O nucleation is one of the most important pathways by which aerosols form in the atmosphere, and the presence of ternary species like amines increases aerosol formation rates. In this study, we focus on the hydration of a ternary system of sulfuric acid (H2SO4), methylamine (NH2CH3), and up to six waters to evaluate its implications for aerosol formation. By combining molecular dynamics (MD) sampling with high-level ab initio calculations, we determine the thermodynamics of forming H2SO4(NH2CH3)(H2O)n, where n = 0\u20136. Because it is a strong acid\u2013base system, H2SO4\u2013NH2CH3 quickly forms a tightly bound HSO4\u2013\u2013NH3CH3+ complex that condenses water more readily than H2SO4 alone. The electronic binding energy of H2SO4\u2013NH2CH3 is \u221221.8 kcal mol\u20131 compared with \u221216.8 kcal mol\u20131 for H2SO4\u2013NH3 and \u221212.8 kcal mol\u20131 for H2SO4\u2013H2O. Adding one to two water molecules to the H2SO4\u2013NH2CH3 complex is more favorable than adding to H2SO4 alone, yet there is no systematic difference for n \u2265 3. However, the average number of water molecules around H2SO4\u2013NH2CH3 is consistently higher than that of H2SO4, and it is fairly independent of temperature and relative humidity.",

Instead, a coupled or multi-stage approach must be used. Different combinations of solvers offer increased utility, often at the cost of model accuracy.

The gas flow in the heated capillary and in the intermediate pressure interface was computed by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. Fully coupled flow of the carrier gas and ions from the capillary nozzle to the skimmer was modeled through the solution of the Boltzmann equation with a force term. The force term defined by local electric field, together with calculated aerodynamic drag, determined the ion trajectories in the gap between the (off-axis) nozzle and skimmer. Three-dimensional modeling of the impact of the voltage applied to the Einzel (tube) lens on the transmission of doubly-charged peptide ions through the skimmer orifice is compared with experimental data obtained in the companion study. Good agreement between measured and computed signals was observed. The numerical results indicate that as many as 75% of the ions that exit from the heated capillary are lost on the conical surface of the skimmer or capillary outer surface. The loss is due to the combined effect of the electrostatic force and plume divergence.",

Methods: We use the hydrodynamic and the magnetohydrodynamic modules of the PLUTO astrophysical code to carry out our simulations. We study the system without a cooling function, with a simplified exponential cooling function, and with a simplified nonequilibrium cooling function. Results: We find evidence that magnetohydrodynamics constrain the shape of the cometary tail and explain features of its far-ultraviolet emission. We suggest an emission process that involves C0 excitation through inelastic electron collisions and a two-photon continuum to explain the luminosity of Mira's tail.",

    "abstract": "Heightened recognition of the prevalence and significance of head injury in sports and in combat veterans has brought increased attention to the physiological and behavioral consequences of concussion. Current clinical practice is in part dependent on patient self-report as the basis for medical decisions and treatment. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) shows promise in the assessment of the pathophysiological derangements in concussion. The authors have developed a novel MEG-based neuroimaging strategy to provide objective, noninvasive, diagnostic information in neurological disorders. In the current study the authors demonstrate a novel task protocol and then assess MEG virtual recordings obtained during task performance as a diagnostic tool for concussion.",

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing amount of computational power available has made it possible to use docking programs to screen large numbers of compounds to search for molecules that inhibit proteins. This technique can be used not only by pharmaceutical companies with large research and development budgets and large research universities, but also at small liberal arts colleges with no special computing equipment beyond the desktop PCs in any campus' computer laboratory. However, despite the availability of significant quantities of compute time available to small colleges to conduct these virtual screens, such as supercomputing time available through grants, we are unaware of any small colleges that do this. We describe the experiences of an interdisciplinary research collaboration between faculty in the Chemistry and Computer Science Departments in a chemistry course where chemistry and biology students were shown how to conduct virtual screens. This project began when the authors, who had been collaborating on drug discovery research using virtual screening, decided that the virtual screening process they were using in their research could be adapted to fit in a couple of lab periods and would complement one of the instructors\u2019 courses on medicinal chemistry. The resulting labs would introduce students to the virtual screening portion of the drug discovery process.",

    "abstract": "Climatological properties, dynamical and thermodynamical characteristics of the Catalina Eddy are examined from the 61 years NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis downscaled to hourly 10 km resolution. The eddy is identified as a mesoscale cyclonic circulation confined to the Southern California Bight. Pattern correlation of wind direction agains the canonical Catalina Eddy is used to extract cases from the downscaled analysis. Validation against published cases and various observations confirmed that the downscaled analysis accurately reproduces Catalina Eddy events. A composite analysis of the initiation phase of the eddy indicates that no apparent large-scale cyclonic/anti-cyclonic large-scale forcing is associated with the eddy formation or decay. The source of the vorticity is located at the coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. It is generated by the convergence of the wind system crossing over the San Rafael Mountains and the large-scale northwesterly flow associated with the subtropical high. This vorticity is advected towards the southeast by the northwesterly flow, which contributes to the formation of the streak of positive vorticity. At 6 hours prior to the mature stage, there is an explosive generation of positive vorticity along the coast, coincident with the phase change of the sea breeze circulation (wind turning from onshore to offshore), resulting in the convergence all along the California coast. The generation of vorticity due to convergence along the coast together with the advection of vorticity from the north resulted in the formation of southerly flow along the coast, forming the Catalina Eddy. The importance of diurnal variation and the lack of large-scale forcing are new findings, which are in sharp contrast to prior studies. These differences are due to the inclusion of many short-lived eddy events detected in our study which have not been included in other studies.",

Domain scientists find it difficult to create new workflows, so many tasks that could benefit from workflow automation are often avoided or done by hand. Two technologies have come together to bring the benefits of workflow to the masses. The Pegasus Workflow Management System can manage workflows comprised of millions of tasks, all the while recording data about the execution and intermediate results so that the provenance of the final result is clear. The HUBzero platform for scientific collaboration provides a venue for building and delivering tools to researchers and educators. With the press of a button, these tools can launch Pegasus workflows on national computing infrastructures and bring results back for plotting and visualization. As a result, the combination of Pegasus and HUBzero is bringing highthroughput computing to a much wider audience.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of XSEDE, the national cyberinfrastructure has evolved from a set of traditional HPC resources to a broader range of digital services. Science gateways, which serve as portals to scientific applications, have also evolved as researchers are dealing with rapidly expanding scientific datasets and the increasingly complex workflows. More and more gateways are being developed to support integrated services for running data-driven applications on HPC resources such as those on XSEDE. To facilitate this type of workflow, there is a pressing need for web-based data management systems that are easy to use, support data upload, sharing, access and management, and can be integrated with advanced computation and storage resources. More importantly such systems need to be accessible by users from the broad research and education communities. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of iData, a web-based community data publishing and sharing system. iData supports both generic file-based data collections and several commonly used environmental data collection formats including time series, GIS vector and raster data. Integrated data processing, visualization and filtering capabilities are provided for these data formats. Currently iData can be downloaded and deployed in a HUBzero-based gateway, and we plan to make it available for non-HUBzero platforms in the future. We present two examples in which iData has been successfully used to support research collaboration in driNET and GEOSHARE projects.",

    "abstract": "The study of surface water hydrology involves understanding the occurrence, distribution and movement of water on the surface of the earth. Because of human impacts in the form of landuse change, the hydrologic processes at one geographic location may be different than other locations under same or different climatic settings. As a result, a tool that educators and students can use to explore hydrology through observed data and computational simulations is needed. The objective of this paper is to present a prototype model sharing and data exploration tool that users can use for education as well as for research. A GIS-enabled model sharing platform for Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), called SWAT Share, is developed that enables students to not only run model simulations online, but also publish, share and visualize model results to study the impact of land use change on hydrology at watershed scale. SWAT Share is developed as a part of the WaterHUB system that is built by combining Purdue\u2019s HUBZero technology and TeraGrid/XSEDE computation resources. Experience of developing and using SWAT Share in a classroom will be presented and discussed. In addition, the development and implementation plan of another tool, called Hydrology Exploration Tool, will be presented.",

    "abstract": "We apply Schr\u00f6dinger functional methods to two gauge theories with fermions in two-index representations: the SU(3) theory with Nf=2 adjoint fermions, and the SU(4) theory with Nf=6 fermions in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Each theory is believed to lie near the bottom of the conformal window for its respective representation. In the SU(3) theory we find a small beta function in strong coupling but we cannot confirm or rule out an infrared fixed point. In the SU(4) theory we find a hint of walking\u2014a beta function that approaches the axis and then turns away from it. In both theories the mass anomalous dimension remains small even at the strongest couplings, much like the theories with fermions in the two-index symmetric representation investigated earlier.",

    "abstract": "Advances in modeling and algorithms, combined with growth in computing resources, have enabled simulations of multiphysics\u2013multiscale phenomena that can greatly enhance our scientific understanding. However, on currently available high-performance computing (HPC) resources, maximizing the scientific outcome of simulations requires many trade-offs. In this paper we describe our experiences in running simulations of the explosion phase of Type Ia supernovae on the largest available platforms. The simulations use FLASH, a modular, adaptive mesh, parallel simulation code with a wide user base. The simulations use multiple physics components: hydrodynamics, gravity, a sub-grid flame model, a three-stage burning model, and a degenerate equation of state. They also use Lagrangian tracer particles, which are then post-processed to determine the nucleosynthetic yields. We describe the simulation planning process, and the algorithmic optimizations and trade-offs that were found to be necessary. Several of the optimizations and trade-offs were made during the course of the simulations as our understanding of the challenges evolved, or when simulations went into previously unexplored physical regimes. We also briefly outline the anticipated challenges of, and our preparations for, the next-generation computing platforms.",

    "abstract": "Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a crucial role as standardizable cosmological candles, though the nature of their progenitors is a subject of active investigation. Recent observational and theoretical work has pointed to merging white dwarf binaries, referred to as the double-degenerate channel, as the possible progenitor systems for some SNe Ia. Additionally, recent theoretical work suggests that mergers which fail to detonate may produce magnetized, rapidly rotating white dwarfs. In this paper, we present the first multidimensional simulations of the post-merger evolution of white dwarf binaries to include the effect of the magnetic field. In these systems, the two white dwarfs complete a final merger on a dynamical timescale, and are tidally disrupted, producing a rapidly rotating white dwarf merger surrounded by a hot corona and a thick, differentially rotating disk. The disk is strongly susceptible to the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and we demonstrate that this leads to the rapid growth of an initially dynamically weak magnetic field in the disk, the spin-down of the white dwarf merger, and to the subsequent central ignition of the white dwarf merger. Additionally, these magnetized models exhibit new features not present in prior hydrodynamic studies of white dwarf mergers, including the development of MRI turbulence in the hot disk, magnetized outflows carrying a significant fraction of the disk mass, and the magnetization of the white dwarf merger to field strengths ~2 \u00d7 108 G. We discuss the impact of our findings on the origins, circumstellar media, and observed properties of SNe Ia and magnetized white dwarfs.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to provide and verify a new design method for the in-plane compressive strength of steel sandwich panels comprised of steel face sheets and foamed steel cores. Foamed steel, literally steel with internal voids, provides enhanced bending rigidity, exceptional energy dissipation, and the potential to mitigate local instability. In this work, Winters effective width expression is generalized to the case of steel foam sandwich panels. The generalization requires modification of the elastic buckling expressions to account for panel non-composite bending rigidity and shear deformations. In addition, an equivalent yield stress is introduced to provide a single parameter description of the yielding behavior of the steel face sheets and steel foam core. The provided analytical expressions are verified with finite element simulations employing three-dimensional continuum elements and calibrated constitutive models specific to metallic foams. The developed closed-form design expressions are employed to conduct parametric studies of steel foam sandwich panels, which (a) demonstrate the significant strength improvements possible when compared with solid steel, and (b) provide insights on the optimal balance between steel face sheet thickness and density of the foamed steel core. This work is part of a larger effort to help develop steel foam as a material with relevance to civil engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents three-level residual-based turbulence models for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Employing the Variational Multiscale (VMS) framework, the velocity and pressure fields are decomposed into two overlapping hierarchical scales, thereby leading to a system of coupled mixed field problems. The mixed problem at the fine scales is stabilized via a subsequent VMS application that results in a further decomposition of the fine-scale velocity field into level-I and level-II scales. The level-II scales are modeled using higher-order bubble functions that are then variationally embedded in the level-I formulation to stabilize it. The level-I problem is modeled via a second set of bubble functions that are linearly independent of the bubbles employed at level-II. Finally, the resulting level-I fine-scales are variationally embedded in the coarse-scale formulation that yields the residual-based turbulence model for the larger or coarser-scales. A significant feature of the proposed method is that it results in a concurrent top-down and bottom up two-way nesting of the scales. In addition, the resulting turbulence model does not possess any embedded tunable parameters. Another attribute of the formulation is that the fine scales at every level are driven by the residuals of the Euler-Lagrange equations of the coarser scales at the preceding levels, thereby resulting in a method that is variationally consistent. Various algorithmic generalizations of the method are presented that lead to computationally economic residual-based turbulence models. The proposed telescopic depth in scales approach helps make these models accurate for low order tetrahedral and hexahedral elements, a feature that is facilitated by the higher-order bubble functions over element interiors and it results in an enhanced representation of the fine-scale terms modeling the fine viscous effects. From a computational perspective this method results in easy-to-implement equal-order pressure-velocity elements, and possesses the desirable p-refinement feature. Numerical performance of the method is assessed on turbulent channel flow problems at Re=395 and Re=590. Also presented are the results for turbulent SD-7003 airfoil at Re=60,000 and comparison is made with the published experimental data and numerical results.",

    "abstract": "The anesthetic propofol inhibits the currents of the homopentameric ligand-gated ion channel GLIC, yet the crystal structure of GLIC with five propofol molecules bound symmetrically shows an open-channel conformation. To address this dilemma and determine if the symmetry of propofol binding sites affects the channel conformational transition, we performed a total of 1.5 \u03bcs of molecular dynamics simulations for different GLIC systems with propofol occupancies of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. GLIC without propofol binding or with five propofol molecules bound symmetrically, showed similar channel conformation and hydration status over multiple replicates of 100-ns simulations. In contrast, asymmetric binding to one, two or three equivalent sites in different subunits accelerated the channel dehydration, increased the conformational heterogeneity of the pore-lining TM2 helices, and shifted the lateral and radial tilting angles of TM2 toward a closed-channel conformation. The results differentiate two groups of systems based on the propofol binding symmetry. The difference between symmetric and asymmetric groups is correlated with the variance in the propofol-binding cavity adjacent to the hydrophobic gate and the force imposed by the bound propofol. Asymmetrically bound propofol produced greater variance in the cavity size that could further elevate the conformation heterogeneity. The force trajectory generated by propofol in each subunit over the course of a simulation exhibits an ellipsoidal shape, which has the larger component tangential to the pore. Asymmetric propofol binding creates an unbalanced force that expedites the channel conformation transitions. The findings from this study not only suggest that asymmetric binding underlies the propofol functional inhibition of GLIC, but also advocate for the role of symmetry breaking in facilitating channel conformational transitions.",

    "abstract": "Ab initio density-functional theory and thermodynamics calculations are combined to establish a microscopic mechanism for the oxidation of the \u03b12-Ti3Al(0001) surface. The surface energies as functions of the chemical potentials, as well as structural relaxations and electronic densities of states, are determined. The surface phase diagram (SPD) of the \u03b12-Ti3Al(0001) systems with different defects and at various oxygen coverages is constructed. It is found that the Al antisite defect prefers to segregate on the \u03b12-Ti3Al(0001) surface and oxygen adsorption enhances the segregation with the formation of the surface with three Al antisites per unit surface cell (i.e. the top surface layer is full of Al atoms) at the initial stage of oxidation, accounting for the aluminum selective oxidation observed experimentally. After the initial stage of oxidation, the O\u2013\u03b12-Ti3Al(0001) system manifests itself with a non-uniform double-phase SPD, suggesting the competition between oxidations of the Al and Ti elements in the oxidation process. This result explains the experimentally observed second regime of oxidation in which both metal elements are oxidized.",

    "abstract": "Rapid photobleaching of fluorescent proteins can limit their use in imaging applications. The underlying kinetics is multi-exponential and strongly depends on the local chromophore environment. The first, reversible, step may be attributed to a rotation around one of the two exocyclic C-C bonds bridging phenol and imidazolinone groups in the chromophore. However it is not clear how the protein environment controls this motion - either by steric hindrances or by modulating the electronic structure of the chromophore through electrostatic interactions. Here we study the first step of the photobleaching kinetics in 13 red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) with different chromophore environment and show that the associated rate strongly correlates with the bond length alternation (BLA) of the two bridge bonds. The sign of the BLA appears to determine which rotation is activated. Our results present experimental evidence for the dominance of electronic effects in the conformational dynamics of the RFP chromophore.",

Some types of applications, such as rare event sampling, additionally require guaranteed completion of all subtasks for analysis, and place significant demands on the workflow management and execution environment. SciFlow is a user interface built over the Hadoop infrastructure that provides a framework to support the complex process and data interactions and guaranteed completion requirements of scientific workflows. It provides an efficient mechanism for building a parallel scientific application with dataflow patterns, and enables the design, deployment, and execution of data intensive, many-task computing tasks on a Hadoop platform. The design principles of this framework emphasize simplicity, scalability and fault-tolerance.

    "abstract": "We attempt to reconcile seemingly conflicting experimental results on the Higgs boson mass, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, null results in the search for supersymmetry at the LHC within the 8 TeV data and results from B-physics, all within the context of supersymmetric grand unified theories. Specifically, we consider a supergravity grand unification model with nonuniversal gaugino masses where we take the SU(3)C gaugino field to be much heavier than the other gaugino and sfermion fields at the unification scale. This construction naturally leads to a large mass splitting between the slepton and squark masses, due to the mass splitting between the electroweak gauginos and the gluino. The heavy Higgs bosons and Higgsinos also follow the gluino toward large masses. We carry out a Bayesian Monte Carlo analysis of the parametric space and find that it can simultaneously explain the large Higgs mass and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, while producing a negligible correction to the Standard Model prediction for \u212cr(B0s\u2192\u03bc+\u03bc\u2212). We also find that the model leads to an excess in the Higgs diphoton decay rate. A brief discussion of the possibility of detecting the light particles is given. Also discussed are the implications of the model for dark matter.",

    "abstract": "The steady state fluorescence spectral maximum (\u03bbmax) for tryptophan 140 of Staphylococcal nuclease remains virtually unchanged when nearby charged groups are removed by mutation, even though large electrostatic effects on \u03bbmax might be expected. To help understand the underlying mechanism of this curious result, we have modeled \u03bbmax with three sets of 50-ns molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water, equilibrated with excited state and with ground state charges. Semiempirical quantum mechanics and independent electrostatic analysis for the wild-type protein and four charge-altering mutants were performed on the chromophore using the coordinates from the simulations. Electrostatic contributions from the nearby charged lysines by themselves contribute 30-90 nm red shifts relative to the gas phase, but in each case, contributions from water create compensating blue shifts that bring the predicted \u03bbmax within 2 nm of the experimental value, 332 \u00b1 0.5 nm for all five proteins. Although long-range collective interactions from ordered water make large blue shifts, crucial for determining the steady state \u03bbmax for absorption and fluorescence, such blue shifts do not contribute to the amplitude of the time dependent Stokes shift following excitation, which comes from nearby charges and only \u223c6 waters tightly networked with those charges. We therefore conclude that for STNase, water and protein effects on the Stokes shift are not separable.",

    "abstract": "Simulations were performed using an idealized cloud model (CM1) to investigate the environmental conditions influential to the duration and intensity of tornado-like vortices spawned from simulated supercells. The environments studied are from RUC-2 soundings taken in close proximity to significantly tornadic (EF2 or greater) supercells. Twenty-one simulations produced a tornado-like vortex, detected using an automated algorithm based on Rankine vortex theory. Longevity is determined by counting the number of times that the tornado was detected (monitored every 30 seconds) and intensity is based upon the maximum central pressure drop relative to the environment several km from the tornado during the tornado's lifetime. A multiple linear regression (analysis of variance) was performed to determine which variables are most influential to tornado duration and intensity. It will be shown at the conference that the variables that explain most of the variance in tornado duration and intensity differ from those that have been previously shown to best discriminate between significantly tornadic and non-tornadic environments.",

    "abstract": "Circulation and circulation budget calculations, in either Eulerian or Lagrangian frameworks, have been used in multi-radar and numerical modeling studies. Each framework has advantages and disadvantages. The Lagrangian framework can be used to determine the source region of important parcels that are maintaining a low-level circulation but accuracy can suffer depending upon the spatial gradients of wind velocity and choice of timestep used for trajectory calculations (Dahl et al. 2012). An Eulerian framework can monitor net changes in circulation within an analysis area and is much less computationally expensive (e.g. Trapp and Weisman 2003), however the parcel source regions cannot be investigated and it may still be sensitive to the choice of the circulation region. In this study, Eulerian circulation analyses were performed for tornado-like vortices and parent supercell mesocyclones simulated with the idealized cloud model, CM1. Starting with a long-lived simulated tornado as a control case (from Naylor and Gilmore 2012), generated from a single RUC sounding, the 0-1 km and 0-3 km shear profile was increased and decreased by 30%, 20%, and 10% while maintaining the shape of the hodograph and new simulations conducted. The altered shear profiles resulted in altered values of storm relative environmental helicity (SREH) and resulted in tornadoes of differing intensity and longevity. The Eulerian circulation analyses among all simulations were then compared to investigate the dominant terms in the circulation budget in relation to the tornado lifecycle and its associated storm environment.",

    "abstract": "We examine the effects of self-gravity and magnetic fields on supersonic turbulence in isothermal molecular clouds with high-resolution simulations and adaptive mesh refinement. These simulations use large root grids (5123) to capture turbulence and four levels of refinement to follow the collapse to high densities, for an effective resolution of 81923. Three Mach 9 simulations are performed, two super-Alfv\u00e9nic and one trans-Alfv\u00e9nic. We find that gravity splits the clouds into two populations, one low-density turbulent state and one high-density collapsing state. The low-density state exhibits properties similar to non-self-gravitating in this regime, and we examine the effects of varied magnetic field strength on statistical properties: the density probability distribution function is approximately lognormal, the velocity power spectral slopes decrease with decreasing mean field strength, the alignment between velocity and magnetic field increases with the field, and the magnetic field probability distribution can be fitted to a stretched exponential. The high-density state is well characterized by self-similar spheres: the density probability distribution is a power law, collapse rate decreases with increasing mean field, density power spectra have positive slopes, P(\u03c1, k)k, thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratios are roughly unity for all mean field strengths, dynamic-to-magnetic pressure ratios are larger than unity for all mean field strengths, the magnetic field distribution follows a power-law distribution. The high Alfv\u00e9n Mach numbers in collapsing regions explain the recent observations of magnetic influence decreasing with density. We also find that the high-density state is typically found in filaments formed by converging flows, consistent with recent Herschel observations. Possible modifications to existing star formation theories are explored. The overall trans-Alfv\u00e9nic nature of star-forming clouds is discussed.",

Effects of electron correlations are probed by comparing projections of the final state of the two-electron wave packet onto field-free highly correlated Jacobi matrix wave functions with projections onto uncorrelated Coulomb wave functions. Significant differences are found in the vicinity of autoionizing resonances. Owing to the broad bandwidths of our 115 and 230 as pulses and their high intensities (1\u20132 PW/cm^2), asymmetries are found in the differential probability for ionization of electrons parallel and antiparallel to the linear polarization axis of the laser pulse. These asymmetries stem from interference of the one- and two-photon ionization amplitudes for producing electrons with the same momentum along the linear polarization axis. Whereas these asymmetries generally decrease with increasing ionized electron",

Using AutoDock Vina, we recently screened the NCI library of about 320,000 compounds against the crystal structure of PfUCHL3. The top hits were subsequently screened against its human ortholog UCHL3 as to identify compounds that could specifically target the PfUCHL3 over its human counterpart. This method was used to identify small molecule inhibitors that can preferentially inhibit the parasitic enzyme. Several compounds were identified that demonstrated significant binding affinity preference for the malaria target over the human enzyme. Two of these compounds demonstrated ng/mL activity.",

This is the energy region where the Stark-effect induced electric dipole energy split in the target dominates the physics and the Long- Range behavior of the 3-body scattering system. It is found that when the center of mass collision energy in the new channels is in integer proportion to the corresponding electric dipole energy split, Bremsstrahlung photon mediated resonant scattering occurs. The corresponding wave amplitudes deform into wave-packets hundreds to thousands of Bohr radii in width. The physical implication of this phenomenon will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule associated protein tau is essential for the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Tau dysfunction is associated with a class of diseases called tauopathies, in which tau is found in an aggregated form. This paper focuses on a small aggregating fragment of tau, 273GKVQIINKKLDL284, encompassing the (PHF6*) region that plays a central role in tau aggregation. Using a combination of simulations and experiments, we probe the self-assembly of this peptide, with an emphasis on characterizing the early steps of aggregation. Ion-mobility mass spectrometry experiments provide a size distribution of early oligomers, TEM studies provide a time course of aggregation, and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistically detailed structural information about this intrinsically disordered peptide. Our studies indicate that a point mutation, as well the addition of heparin, lead to a shift in the conformations populated by the earliest oligomers, affecting the kinetics of subsequent fibril formation as well as the morphology of the resulting aggregates. In particular, a mutant associated with a K280 deletion (a mutation that causes a heritable form of neurodegeneration/dementia in the context of full length tau) is seen to aggregate more readily than its wild-type counterpart. Simulations and experiment reveal that the \u0394K280 mutant peptide adopts extended conformations to a greater extent than the wild-type peptide, facilitating aggregation through the pre-structuring of the peptide into a fibril-competent structure.",

    "abstract": "Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy evolution are increasingly able to produce realistic galaxies, but the largest hurdle remaining is in constructing subgrid models that accurately describe the behaviour of stellar feedback. As an alternate way to test and calibrate such models, we propose to focus on the circumgalactic medium (CGM). To do so, we generate a suite of adaptive mesh refinement simulations for a Milky-Way-massed galaxy run to z = 0, systematically varying the feedback implementation. We then post-process the simulation data to compute the absorbing column density for a wide range of common atomic absorbers throughout the galactic halo, including H I, Mg II, Si II, Si III, Si IV, C IV, N V, O VI and O VII. The radial profiles of these atomic column densities are compared against several quasar absorption line studies to determine if one feedback prescription is favoured. We find that although our models match some of the observations (specifically those ions with lower ionization strengths), it is particularly difficult to match O VI observations. There is some indication that the models with increased feedback intensity are better matches. We demonstrate that sufficient metals exist in these haloes to reproduce the observed column density distribution in principle, but the simulated CGM lacks significant multiphase substructure and is generally too hot. Furthermore, we demonstrate the failings of inflow-only models (without energetic feedback) at populating the CGM with adequate metals to match observations even in the presence of multiphase structure. Additionally, we briefly investigate the evolution of the CGM from z = 3 to present. Overall, we find that quasar absorption line observations of the gas around galaxies provide a new and important constraint on feedback models.",

    "abstract": "This brief communication quantifies the time-events that contribute to the dynamics of wall-bounded flows with rough walls. Lumley\u2019s Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) methodology has been used to extract the energetic modes of the flow. We have used the concept of entropy, a representation of lack of organization in the flow, to represent the extent of spread of turbulent kinetic energy to higher modes. The rough-wall dynamics is dominated by fast activity (short time period) propagating modes and slow activity (long time period) roll modes. A single dominant timescale has been captured for all the propagating modes in flows over smooth walls; multiple dominant timescales representing various vortex shedding events are captured for rough walls. Variable-interval time averaging technique has been used to obtain the bursting frequency. The bursting frequency of rough-wall turbulence is higher compared to smooth-wall turbulence, suggesting that roughness enhances turbulence production activity. Another insightful observation for rough walls revealed by our study is that the vortex shedding frequency of roughness elements is much higher compared to the bursting frequency of rough-wall turbulence. POD provides a straightforward method to extract the natural frequency of shed vortices due to roughness, an important dynamical activity in rough-wall turbulent boundary layers.",

A third pulse was introduced to experimentally probe the response, as a function of the lattice velocity, of the gas to the deep monochromatic potential wells formed by the lasers. Coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS) line shapes were recorded and compared to numerically predicted magnitudes of the density perturbations induced in the gas. Both experimental results and those from direct simulation Monte Carlo simulations show a deviation from previously published low-intensity CRBS line-shape models. The deviation indicates a trend, as a function of lattice velocity, similar to that relating to previously published energy and momentum transfer calculations for high-intensity lattices. Furthermore, the deviation indicates a maximum intensity at which current CRBS theory is valid.",

    "abstract": "To improve the understanding of the near-wall region in a rough-wall turbulent boundary layer, we use a three level decomposition as an alternative formulation to the classical Reynolds decomposition. The instantaneous flow variable is now decomposed to a time-space averaged mean flow, a steady mean wake flow around the roughness (i.e. steady but spatiall y varying motions), and a residual fluctuating flow. In this paper, we present the momentum transport equations for these three components of the de composition.These transport equations for the three velocity component s will facilitate to establish and understand the local interactions of the mean flow, turbulence and wall roughness. We analyze the relative significance of t hese terms. The fundamental equations are derived within the immersed boun dary representation of roughness elements. Total shear stress for rough- wall is obtained from the stress balance equation consisting of stress due to the roughness wake components, the Reynolds stress, the viscous stress and the stress due to the boundary force from the roughness. In order to evaluat e the relative contribution of the components in this three-level decompo sition, we use direct numerical simulation (DNS) to simulate flow in a channel with rough-walls. Surface roughness has been introduced using an immer sed boundary methods. The flow simulations are performed at Re\u03c4= 180 and roughness height k+=5,10,20 for egg-carton roughness elements",

    "abstract": "The paper deals with numerical investigation of the effect of plaque morphology on the flow characteristics in a diseased coronary artery using realistic plaque morphology. The morphological information of the lumen and the plaque is obtained from intravascular ultrasound imaging measurements of 42 patients performed at Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio. For this data, study of Bhaganagar et al. (2010) [1] has revealed the stenosis for 42 patients can be categorized into four types \u2013 type I (peak-valley), type II (ascending), type III (descending), and type IV (diffuse). The aim of the present study is to isolate the effect of shape of the stenosis on the flow characteristics for a given degree of the stenosis. In this study, we conduct fluid dynamic simulations for the four stenosis types (type I\u2013IV) and analyze the differences in the flow characteristics between these types. Finely refined tetrahedral mesh for the 3-D solid model of the artery with plaques has been generated. The 3-D steady flow simulations were performed using the turbulence (k\u2013\u03b5) model in a finite volume based computational fluid dynamics solver. The axial velocity, the radial velocity, turbulence kinetic energy and wall shear stress profiles of the plaque have been analyzed. From the axial and radial velocity profiles results the differences in the velocity patterns are significantly visible at proximal as well as distal to the throat, region of maximum stenosis. Turbulent kinetic energy and wall shear stress profiles have revealed significant differences in the vicinity of the plaque. Additional unsteady flow simulations have been performed to validate the hypothesis of the significance of plaque morphology in flow alterations in diseased coronary artery. The results revealed the importance of accounting for plaque morphology in addition to plaque height to accurately characterize the turbulent flow in a diseased coronary artery.",

Our model incorporated both the self-consistent Poisson-Nernst-Planck simulations for the electric potential of a solid state membrane immersed in an electrolyte solution together with the Brownian dynamics of the biomolecule. In this paper, we study how the applied electrolyte bias, the semiconductor membrane bias, and the semiconductor material type (n-Si or p-Si) affect the translocation dynamics of a single-stranded DNA moving through a nanopore in a single-layered semiconductor membrane. We show that the type of semiconductor material used for the membrane has a prominent effect on the biomolecule's translocation time, with DNA exhibiting much longer translocation times through the p-type membrane than through the n type at the same electrolyte and membrane potentials, while the extension of the biomolecule remains practically unchanged. In addition, we find the optimal combination for the membrane-electrolyte system's parameters to achieve the longest translocation time and largest DNA extension. With our single-layered electrically tunable membranes, the DNA translocation time can be manipulated to have an order of magnitude increase.",

Two recent works have reported the crystal structure of stimulating and blocking type antibody-Fab fragments binding to the ectodomain of the TSHR . However, as of today no crystal structure of the TSH-TSHR complex has been reported. In this work, homology modeling of TSH has been carried out with Modeller (Sali and Blundell 1993) using the crystal structure (PDB ID: 1FL7) of the related follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) as the template (Fox, Dias et al. 2001) . A fast molecular dynamics minimization of the structure has been performed as part of the Modeller routine. Docking of TSH on the TSHR was carried out on the HEX server (http://hexserver.loria.fr/) and residual contacts of the TSH-TSHR complex have been identified. Conformational studies and the free energy of binding will be reported based on Molecular Dynamics simulations using the AMBER force field. The calculations will be complemented by experimental determination of the binding affinity using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).

    "abstract": "The advent of molecularly targeted therapies requires effective identification of the various cell types of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). Currently, cell type diagnosis is performed using small biopsies or cytology specimens that are often insufficient for molecular testing after morphologic analysis. Thus, the ability to rapidly recognize different cancer cell types, with minimal tissue consumption, would accelerate diagnosis and preserve tissue samples for subsequent molecular testing in targeted therapy. We report a label-free molecular vibrational imaging framework enabling three-dimensional (3-D) image acquisition and quantitative analysis of cellular structures for identification of NSCLC cell types. This diagnostic imaging system employs superpixel-based 3-D nuclear segmentation for extracting such disease-related features as nuclear shape, volume, and cell-cell distance. These features are used to characterize cancer cell types using machine learning. Using fresh unstained tissue samples derived from cell lines grown in a mouse model, the platform showed greater than 97% accuracy for diagnosis of NSCLC cell types within a few minutes. As an adjunct to subsequent histology tests, our novel system would allow fast delineation of cancer cell types with minimum tissue consumption, potentially facilitating on-the-spot diagnosis, while preserving specimens for additional tests. Furthermore, 3-D measurements of cellular structure permit evaluation closer to the native state of cells, creating an alternative to traditional 2-D histology specimen evaluation, potentially increasing accuracy in diagnosing cell type of lung carcinomas.",

Despite some similarity with conventional mechanisms based on averaging of fast oscillation-type motion or radiation-pressure effects, we demonstrate that, for diffusional (i.e., strongly damped) adatom motion, the origin of time-averaged structuring is essentially different. The proposed analytical model and kinetic Monte\u2013Carlo (kMC) simulations reveal several distinct structuring regimes and directly relate them to the transient modification of diffusion barriers and adiabatic temperature variations induced by SAW strains.",

    "abstract": "Predicting thermal conductivity, k, of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been the focus of many molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies reported in the literature. The values of k obtained in these studies exhibit a large, up to an order of magnitude, variability that is commonly attributed to the variations in the computational setups adopted in different studies. The sensitivity of the computational results to the choice of individual parameters of the simulation setups, however, has not been systematically investigated and is often overlooked when the predicted values of k are compared across the literature. Here we present the results of several series of simulations specifically designed to evaluate the effects of common computational parameters of non-equilibrium MD (NEMD), such as the type of boundary conditions, size and location of heat bath regions, definition of the CNT length, and the choice of interatomic potential, on the computational predictions. The length dependence of thermal conductivity is found to exhibit a gradual transition from a strong increase of k with CNT length for nanotubes that are shorter than \u223c200 nm to a much weaker dependence for longer CNTs, reflecting the transition from ballistic to diffusive-ballistic heat transport regimes. The effect of increasing length of thermal bath regions is found to be nearly indistinguishable from the effect of increasing length of the unperturbed region between the bath regions, suggesting that the value of k is defined by the total length of the CNT (including the length of the heat bath regions) in NEMD simulations employing uni-directional heat flux. The choice of interatomic potential is shown to be responsible for an up to fourfold variability in predictions of k for otherwise identical simulation conditions. Overall, the results of this study help elucidate the cause of quantitative discrepancies across published data and provide recommendations on the choice of simulation setups that may improve the consistency of the computational predictions.",

    "abstract": "The microscopic mechanisms of femtosecond laser ablation of an Al target are investigated in large-scale massively parallel atomistic simulations performed with a computational model combining classical molecular dynamics technique with a continuum description of the laser excitation and subsequent relaxation of conduction band electrons. The relatively large lateral size of the computational systems used in the simulations enables a detailed analysis of the evolution of multiple voids generated in a sub-surface region of the irradiated target in the spallation regime, when the material ejection is driven by the relaxation of laser-induced stresses. The nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids take place within a broad ( \u223c100 nm) region of the target, leading to the formation of a transient foamy structure of interconnected liquid regions and eventual separation (or spallation) of a thin liquid layer from the bulk of the target. The thickness of the spalled layer is decreasing from the maximum of \u223c50 nm while the temperature and ejection velocity are increasing with increasing fluence. At a fluence of \u223c2.5 times the spallation threshold, the top part of the target reaches the conditions for an explosive decomposition into vapor and small clusters/droplets, marking the transition to the phase explosion regime of laser ablation. This transition is signified by a change in the composition of the ablation plume from large liquid droplets to a mixture of vapor-phase atoms and clusters/droplets of different sizes. The clusters of different sizes are spatially segregated in the expanding ablation plume, where small/medium size clusters present in the middle of the plume are followed by slower (velocities of less than 3 km/s) large droplets consisting of more than 10,000 atoms. The similarity of some of the characteristics of laser ablation of Al targets (e.g., evolution of voids in the spallation regime and cluster size distributions in the phase explosion regime) to the ones observed in earlier simulations performed for different target materials points to the common mechanical and thermodynamic origins of the underlying processes.",

    "abstract": "While it is clear that ambient noise correlations contain information on seismic attenuation, retrieval of that information requires disentangling the influences of site amplification factors and anisotropic noise intensity. Recent work has argued that recognition that ambient noise intensity is governed by a radiative transfer equation will facilitate that retrieval. This sufficiently constrains the noise field to permit amplitudes of noise correlation waveforms to be fit to models of spatially varying attenuation, noise intensity and site amplification factors. Numerical simulations, for the case of a uniformly spaced linear array of receivers, homogeneous attenuation and wave speed and mild directionality to the noise field, were shown earlier to be consistent with the assertion. Here, the numerical simulations are extended to a broader class of systems. Accurate retrieval is demonstrated using a priori error estimates and weighted least-squares fitting. Attenuations and site factors are retrieved in systems with spatially varying attenuation, highly directional noise intensities, irregular line arrays and poor signal-to-noise ratios. Examination of a variety of systems illustrates some of the range of applicability and limits of the approach.",

Significant focus has been placed on understanding the mechanism of dissociation, with most approaches using equilibrium thermodynamic arguments.

An important consequence of complexation is that excess protons are not isolated following initial fragmentation and can participate in subsequent chemical reactions.

The measured surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factor, EFexp = 3 \u00d7 107 at 532 nm, corresponds to the observed signal strength of a single DBDT molecule, the Raman cross section of which was determined to be d\u03c3/d\u03a9 = 6 \u00d7 10\u201328 cm2/sr. We show that the product of the local field enhancement, EFP = (Ei/E0)2(Es/E0)2= 3 \u00d7 106, and the chemical contribution due to reduced detuning, EFC = (\u03940/\u0394)2 = 12, account for the observed effect. The chemical contribution is assessed by exploring model structures Agn\u2013S\u2013DB\u2013S\u2013Agm (n, m = 0, 3, 7, 20). The \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transition at 287 nm, which determines the polarizability of the bare molecule, acquires a DBDT-to-silver charge-transfer character upon binding to silver. The CT transition near 400 nm reduces the detuning but remains nonresonant at 532 nm. We observe a soft polarization dependence, which suggests optical activity, which in part is ascribed to coupling between plasmons and conjugated electrons of DBDT. Modest enhancement factors are sufficient to detect single molecules through nonresonant SERS.",

    "abstract": "We determine the liquid-solid phase diagram for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-selenium plasma mixtures using two-phase molecular dynamics simulations. We identify liquid, solid, and interface regions using a bond angle metric. To study finite-size effects, we perform 27 648- and 55 296-ion simulations. To help monitor nonequilibrium effects, we calculate diffusion constants Di. For the carbon-oxygen system we find that DO for oxygen ions in the solid is much smaller than DC for carbon ions and that both diffusion constants are 80 or more times smaller than diffusion constants in the liquid phase. There is excellent agreement between our carbon-oxygen phase diagram and that predicted by Medin and Cumming. This suggests that errors from finite-size and nonequilibrium effects are small and that the carbon-oxygen phase diagram is now accurately known. The oxygen-selenium system is a simple two-component model for more complex rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis ash compositions for an accreting neutron star. Diffusion of oxygen, in a predominantly selenium crystal, is remarkably fast, comparable to diffusion in the liquid phase. We find a somewhat lower melting temperature for the oxygen-selenium system than that predicted by Medin and Cumming. This is probably because of electron screening effects.",

    "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence indicate a strong relationship between A beta peptide-induced neurite degeneration and the progressive loss of cognitive functions in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and in AD animal models. This prompted us to develop a high content screening assay (HCS) and Neurite Image Quantitator (NeuriteIQ) software to quantify the loss of neuronal projections induced by A beta peptide neurons and enable us to identify new classes of neurite-protective small molecules, which may represent new leads for AD drug discovery. We identified thirty-six inhibitors of A beta-induced neurite loss in the 1,040-compound National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) custom collection of known bioactives and FDA approved drugs. Activity clustering showed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were significantly enriched among the hits. Notably, NSAIDs have previously attracted significant attention as potential drugs for AD; however their mechanism of action remains controversial. Our data revealed that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was increased following A beta treatment. Furthermore, multiple distinct classes of COX inhibitors efficiently blocked neurite loss in primary neurons, suggesting that increased COX activity contributes to A beta peptide-induced neurite loss. Finally, we discovered that the detrimental effect of COX activity on neurite integrity may be mediated through the inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma(PPAR gamma) activity. Overall, our work establishes the feasibility of identifying small molecule inhibitors of A beta-induced neurite loss using the NeuriteIQ pipeline and provides novel insights into the mechanisms of neuroprotection by NSAIDs.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that alcohols can have strong effects on protein structures. For example, monohydric methanol and ethanol normally denature, whereas polyhydric glycol and glycerol protect, protein structures. In a recent combined theoretical and NMR experimental study, we showed that molecular dynamics simulations can be effectively used to understand the molecular mechanism of methanol denaturing protein. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how alcohols with varied hydrophobicity and different numbers of hydrophilic groups (hydroxyl groups) exert effects on the structure of the model polypeptide, BBA5. First, we showed that methanol and trifluoroethanol (TFE) but not glycol or glycerol disrupt hydrophobic interactions. The latter two alcohols instead protect the assembly of the a-and beta-domains of the polypeptide. Second, all four alcohols were shown to generally increase the stability of secondary structures, as revealed by the increased number of backbone hydrogen bonds formed in alcohol/water solutions compared to that in pure water, although individual hydrogen bonds can be weakened by certain alcohols, such as TFE. The two monohydric alcohols, methanol and TFE, display apparently different sequence-dependence in affecting the backbone hydrogen bond stability: methanol tends to enhance the stability of backbone hydrogen bonds of which the carbonyl groups are from polar residues, whereas TFE tends to stabilize those involving non-polar residues. These results demonstrated that subtle differences in the solution environment could have distinct consequences on protein structures.",

In this study, hydrophobic cavity\u2013ligand association in a model system is characterized through the analysis of the structure, dynamics, and corresponding spectral signatures of water at different stages of the binding process. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the reorientation of the water molecules around the ligand becomes faster as the receptor\u2013ligand distance reduces, which is correlated with the decrease in number of water\u2013water hydrogen bonds within the ligand hydration shells. Prompted by the need for calculating physical quantities that can be amenable to experimental validation, the changes in the spectroscopic features upon cavity\u2013ligand binding are investigated. The analysis of both linear and nonlinear infrared spectra allows direct insight into the evolution of water structure and dynamics around the ligand. In particular, characteristic spectroscopic features emerge at key stages of the binding process, which are related to changes in the hydrogen-bond topology of water around the ligand. This study demonstrates that computer simulations and vibrational spectroscopy could be integrated to facilitate the direct study of solvent effects in biomolecular association.",

    "abstract": "We have determined what makes the first monomer insertion (initiation) facile or slow for many homogeneous olefin polymerization catalysts. Specifically, we have developed the first comprehensive and mechanistically detailed quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) that successfully predicts relative chain initiation to propagation rates for a large series of group 4 single-site olefin polymerization catalysts. This QSAR correctly predicts (a) whether initiation is facile or slow and (b) the ki/kp ratio for a catalyst family with slow initiation. Monomer concentration versus time profiles were measured for batch polymerization of 1-hexene catalyzed by 27 Cp\u2032Ti(OAr)Me2 and Cp*Zr(OC6H-2,3,5,6-Ph4)J2 (J = Me, CH2Ph) complexes activated with B(C6F5)3. Comparison of DFT calculations to experimental data revealed that the underlying cause of slow versus facile initiation is the difference in docking site opening sizes between the initiation kinetically dominant ion pair (i-KDIP) and the propagation kinetically dominant ion pair (p-KDIP). Specifically, initiation is facile if the i-KDIP and p-KDIP have similar docking site opening sizes or the i-KDIP docking site opening is not small but slow if the i-KDIP has a small docking site opening and the p-KDIP has a much larger docking site opening. The ion pairing dynamics was strongly influenced by (a) the choice of solvent, (b) whether or not the catalyst exhibits opportunistic ligand coordination, and (c) the type of initiating group. DFT-computed transition states for selected systems confirmed the underlying chemical mechanism that gives rise to this QSAR.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that baroclinic vortex amplification is strongly dependent on certain factors, namely, the global entropy gradient, the efficiency of thermal diffusion and/or relaxation as well as numerical resolution. We conduct a comprehensive study of a broad range and combination of various entropy gradients, thermal diffusion and thermal relaxation timescales via local shearing sheet simulations covering the parameter space relevant for protoplanetary disks. We measure the Reynolds stresses as a function of our control parameters and see that there is angular momentum transport even for entropy gradients as low as \u03b2 = -dln s/dln r = 1/2. Values we expect in protoplanetary disks are between \u03b2 = 0.5-2.0 The amplification-rate of the perturbations, \u0393, appears to be proportional to \u03b22 and thus proportional to the square of the Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency (\u0393vprop\u03b22vpropN 2). The saturation level of Reynolds stresses, on the other hand, seems to be proportional to \u03b21/2. This highlights the importance of baroclinic effects even for the low entropy gradients expected in protoplanetary disks.",

However, these analyses have largely ignored the fact that some debris disks are found to contain small quantities of gas, a component that all such disks should contain at some level. Several debris disks have been measured with a dust-to-gas ratio of about unity, at which the effect of hydrodynamics on the structure of the disk cannot be ignored. Here we report linear and nonlinear modelling that shows that dust-gas interactions can produce some of the key patterns attributed to planets. We find a robust clumping instability that organizes the dust into narrow, eccentric rings, similar to the Fomalhaut debris disk. The conclusion that such disks might contain planets is not necessarily required to explain these systems.",

    "abstract": "We propose an efficient and accurate scheme to calculate the melting point (MP) of materials. This method is based on the statistical analysis of small-size coexistence molecular dynamics simulations. It eliminates the risk of metastable superheated solid in the fast-heating method, while also significantly reducing the computer cost relative to the traditional large-scale coexistence method. Using empirical potentials, we validate the method and systematically study the finite-size effect on the calculated MPs. The method converges to the exact result in the limit of large system size. An accuracy within 100 K in MP is usually achieved when simulation contains more than 100 atoms. Density functional theory examples of tantalum, high-pressure sodium, and ionic material NaCl are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the method in its practical applications. The method serves as a promising approach for large-scale automated material screening in which the MP is a design criterion.",

Conformations of this peptide at several water\u2013oil interfaces and in protein environments were compared using atomistic simulations with explicit solvents. In oil-containing solvents, this peptide is able to retain a folded structure. Interestingly, when the peptide is immersed in a low-polarity solvent environment, it exhibits a \u201ccoalesced\u201d helix structure, which has both \u03b1- and 310-helix components. The observation that the 310-helical conformation is populated in a highly nonpolar environment is consistent with a previous report on polymethylalanine. Frequent interconversions of the secondary structure (between \u03b1-helix and 310-helix) of the peptide are also observed. We further studied how this solvent-induced structural transition may be connected to the trigger mechanism of lipase gating and how the lipase senses the hydrophobic\u2013hydrophilic interface.",

    "abstract": "In a recent study, Isaza and Collins [J. Fluid Mech., 637 (2009), pp. 213\u2013239] found the asymptotic state of homogeneous turbulent shear flows (HTSFs) to be sensitively dependent on the initial shear parameter (S*), and yet be almost independent of the initial Reynolds number (R\u03bb). The stringent resolution criteria they employed, however, restricted their studies to relatively low Reynolds numbers. In this paper, we present higher resolution direct numerical simulations of HTSFs over a wider range of Reynolds numbers, aided in part by an improved parallelisation scheme that utilises two-dimensional domain decomposition. We maximise the time-window for our simulations by determining appropriate settings for the initial energy spectrum, viscosity and domain configuration, thereby ensuring that we attain the highest possible asymptotic Reynolds number at the chosen grid resolution. In the course of our study, we find that the pseudo-spectral method suffers from Gibbs oscillations while resolving the thin vortical structures that tend to form in HTSFs. The nonlinear growth of these oscillations leads to spurious energy buildup in the high-wavenumber region of the spectrum, and contaminates the flow field. Consequently, the growth of the integral length scale is found to be numerically stunted, well before the intended final Reynolds number is attained. The issue is rectified by the application of exponential-type spectral filters, which stabilise the simulations and extend the runtime window, permitting attainment of larger asymptotic Reynolds numbers. Various large-scale flow statistics are then studied, and their dependence on the initial value of the shear parameter and Reynolds number corroborates the findings of Isaza and Collins.",

    "abstract": "Host\u2013guest inclusion complexes are useful models for understanding the structural and energetic aspects of molecular recognition. Due to their small size relative to much larger protein\u2013ligand complexes, converged results can be obtained rapidly for these systems thus offering the opportunity to more reliably study fundamental aspects of the thermodynamics of binding. In this work, we have performed a large scale binding affinity survey of 57 \u03b2-cyclodextrin (CD) host\u2013guest systems using the binding energy distribution analysis method (BEDAM) with implicit solvation (OPLS-AA/AGBNP2). Converged estimates of the standard binding free energies are obtained for these systems by employing techniques such as parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics, conformational reservoirs, and multistate free energy estimators. Good agreement with experimental measurements is obtained in terms of both numerical accuracy and affinity rankings. Overall, average effective binding energies reproduce affinity rank ordering better than the calculated binding affinities, even though calculated binding free energies, which account for effects such as conformational strain and entropy loss upon binding, provide lower root-mean-square errors when compared to measurements. Interestingly, we find that binding free energies are superior rank order predictors for a large subset containing the most flexible guests. The results indicate that, while challenging, accurate modeling of reorganization effects can lead to ligand design models of superior predictive power for rank ordering relative to models based only on ligand\u2013receptor interaction energies.",

    "abstract": "The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) is routinely used for computing free energies and expectations from multiple ensembles. Existing derivations of WHAM require observations to be discretized into a finite number of bins. Yet, WHAM formulas seem to hold even if the bin sizes are made arbitrarily small. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate both the validity and value of the multi-state Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) method seen as a binless extension of WHAM. We discuss two statistical arguments to derive the MBAR equations, in parallel to the self-consistency and maximum likelihood derivations already known for WHAM. We show that the binless method, like WHAM, can be used not only to estimate free energies and equilibrium expectations, but also to estimate equilibrium distributions. We also provide a number of useful results from the statistical literature, including the determination of MBAR estimators by minimization of a convex function. This leads to an approach to the computation of MBAR free energies by optimization algorithms, which can be more effective than existing algorithms. The advantages of MBAR are illustrated numerically for the calculation of absolute protein-ligand binding free energies by alchemical transformations with and without soft-core potentials. We show that binless statistical analysis can accurately treat sparsely distributed interaction energy samples as obtained from unmodified interaction potentials that cannot be properly analyzed using standard binning methods. This suggests that binless multi-state analysis of binding free energy simulations with unmodified potentials offers a straightforward alternative to the use of soft-core potentials for these alchemical transformations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how kinetics in the unfolded state affects protein folding is a fundamentally important yet less well-understood issue. Here we employ three different models to analyze the unfolded landscape and folding kinetics of the miniprotein Trp-cage. The first is a 208 \u03bcs explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation from D. E. Shaw Research containing tens of folding events. The second is a Markov state model (MSM-MD) constructed from the same ultralong MD simulation; MSM-MD can be used to generate thousands of folding events. The third is a Markov state model built from temperature replica exchange MD simulations in implicit solvent (MSM-REMD). All the models exhibit multiple folding pathways, and there is a good correspondence between the folding pathways from direct MD and those computed from the MSMs. The unfolded populations interconvert rapidly between extended and collapsed conformations on time scales \u226440 ns, compared with the folding time of 5 \u03bcs. The folding rates are independent of where the folding is initiated from within the unfolded ensemble. About 90% of the unfolded states are sampled within the first 40 \u03bcs of the ultralong MD trajectory, which on average explores 27% of the unfolded state ensemble between consecutive folding events. We clustered the folding pathways according to structural similarity into \u201ctubes\u201d, and kinetically partitioned the unfolded state into populations that fold along different tubes. From our analysis of the simulations and a simple kinetic model, we find that, when the mixing within the unfolded state is comparable to or faster than folding, the folding waiting times for all the folding tubes are similar and the folding kinetics is essentially single exponential despite the presence of heterogeneous folding paths with nonuniform barriers. When the mixing is much slower than folding, different unfolded populations fold independently, leading to nonexponential kinetics. A kinetic partition of the Trp-cage unfolded state is constructed which reveals that different unfolded populations have almost the same probability to fold along any of the multiple folding paths. We are investigating whether the results for the kinetics in the unfolded state of the 20-residue Trp-cage is representative of larger single domain proteins.",

    "abstract": "In late 2010, The Georgia Institute of Technology along with its partners - the Oak Ridge National Lab, the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, and the National Institute for Computational Sciences, deployed the Keeneland Initial Delivery System (KIDS) - a 201 Teraflop, 120node HP SL390 system with 240 Intel Xeon CPUs and 360 NVIDIA Fermi graphics processors as a part of the Keeneland Project. The Keeneland Project is a five-year Track 2D cooperative agreement awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2009 for the deployment of an innovative high performance computing system in order to bring emerging architectures to the open science community, KIDS is being used to develop programming tools and libraries in order to ensure that the project can productively accelerate important scientific and engineering applications. Until late 2011, there was no formal mechanism in place for quantifying the efficiency of GPU usage on the Keeneland system because most applications did not have the appropriate administrative tools and vendor support. GPU administration has largely been an afterthought as vendors in this space are focused on gaming and video applications. There is a compelling need to monitor GPU utilization on Keeneland for the purposes of proper system administration and future planning for Keeneland Final System, which is expected to be in production in July 2012. With the release of CUDA 4.1, NVIDIA added enhanced functionality to the nvidia-system management interface (nvidia-smi) tool, which is a management and monitoring command line utility that leverages the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML). NVML is a C-based API for monitoring and managing various states of the NVIDIA GPU devices. It provides a direct access to the queries and commands exposed via nvidia-smi. Using nvidia-smi, a monitoring tool was built for KIDS, to monitor utilization and memory usage on the GPUs. In this paper, we discuss the development of the GPU Utilization tool in depth, and its implementation details on KIDS. We also provide an analysis of the utilization statistics generated by this tool. For example, we identify utilization trends across jobs submitted on KIDS - such as overall GPU utilization as compared to CPU utilization. We also examine GPU utilization from the perspective of software - which packages are most frequently used, and how do they compare with respect to GPU utilization and memory usage. Collection and analysis of this data is essential for facilitating heterogeneous computing on the Keeneland Initial Delivery System. Future direction for the usage of these statistics is to provide insights on overall usage of the system, determine appropriate ratios for jobs (CPU to GPU, GPU to host memory), assist in scheduling policy management, and determine software utilization. These statistics become even more relevant as the center prepares for the deployment of the Keeneland Final System. As heterogeneous computing appears to be more and more common, and is quickly becoming the standard, this information will help greatly in delivering consistent high uptime and assist software developers in writing more efficient code for the majority of the codebases aimed at heterogeneous systems.",

    "abstract": "Symbiosis is well known to influence bacterial symbiont genome evolution and has recently been shown to shape eukaryotic host genomes. Intriguing patterns of host genome evolution, including remarkable numbers of gene duplications, have been observed in the pea aphid, a sap-feeding insect that relies on a bacterial endosymbiont for amino acid provisioning. Previously, we proposed that gene duplication has been important for the evolution of symbiosis based on aphid-specific gene duplication in amino acid transporters (AATs), with some paralogs highly expressed in the cells housing symbionts (bacteriocytes). Here, we use a comparative approach to test the role of gene duplication in enabling recruitment of AATs to bacteriocytes. Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we annotate AATs from sap-feeding and non sap-feeding insects and find that, like aphids, AAT gene families have undergone independent large-scale gene duplications in three of four additional sap-feeding insects. RNA-seq differential expression data indicate that, like aphids, the sap-feeding citrus mealybug possesses several lineage-specific bacteriocyte-enriched paralogs. Further, differential expression data combined with quantitative PCR support independent evolution of bacteriocyte enrichment in sap-feeding insect AATs. Although these data indicate that gene duplication is not necessary to initiate host/symbiont amino acid exchange, they support a role for gene duplication in enabling AATs to mediate novel host/symbiont interactions broadly in the sap-feeding suborder Sternorrhyncha. In combination with recent studies on other symbiotic systems, gene duplication is emerging as a general pattern in host genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a complex of multidrug resistant Gram-positive bacterial strains, has proven especially problematic in both hospital and community-settings, resulting in increased mortality rates and hospitalization costs. Emergence of resistance even to vancomycin, the standard reference for MRSA treatment, builds up pressure for the search of novel alternatives. We report potent natural resin acid-based cationic antimicrobial compounds and polymers that exhibit surprising antimicrobial activity against a range of MRSA strains, yet are largely non-toxic against mammalian cells. Molecular dynamics simulations and dye-leakage assays with anionic phospholipid membrane mimics of bacteria demonstrate a membrane-lysing effect induced by unique fused ring structures of resin acids that may constitute the principal mechanism of action for selective lysis of bacterial cells over mammalian cells. Our antimicrobial materials are derived from an unlikely yet abundant natural source, and offer a novel alternative to currently-used approaches.",

We present the future computing needs and plans of the U.S. lattice gauge theory community and argue that continued support of the U.S. (and worldwide) lattice-QCD effort is essential to fully capitalize on the enormous investment in the high-energy physics experimental program. We first summarize the dramatic progress of numerical lattice-QCD simulations in the past decade, with some emphasis on calculations carried out under the auspices of the U.S. Lattice-QCD Collaboration, and describe a broad program of lattice-QCD calculations that will be relevant for future experiments at the intensity and energy frontiers. We then present details of the computational hardware and software resources needed to undertake these calculations.",

We use gauge configurations generated by the MILC collaboration with Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 flavors of sea quarks, which incorporate the effects of dynamical charm quarks as well as those of up, down, and strange. We employ data at three lattice spacings to extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our result, f+(0) = 0.9704(32), where the error is the total statistical plus systematic uncertainty added in quadrature, is the most precise determination to date. Combining our result with the latest experimental measurements of K semileptonic decays, one obtains the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |Vus| = 0.22290(74)(52), where the first error is from f+(0) and the second one is from experiment. In the first-row test of Cabibbo- Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity, the error stemming from |Vus| is now comparable to that from |Vud|.",

    "abstract": "Simulations of CO2 and H2 sorption and separation were performed in [Cu(dpa)2SiF6-i], a metal\u2013organic material (MOM) consisting of an interpenetrated square grid of Cu2+ ions coordinated to 4,4\u2032-dipyridylacetylene (dpa) rings and pillars of SiF62\u2013 ions. This class of water stable MOMs shows great promise in practical gas sorption/separation with especially high selectivity for CO2 and variable selectivity for other energy related gases. Simulated CO2 sorption isotherms and isosteric heats of adsorption, Qst, at ambient temperatures were in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements at all pressures considered. Further, it was observed that the Qst for CO2 increases as a function of uptake in [Cu(dpa)2SiF6-i]. This suggests that nascently sorbed CO2 molecules within a channel contribute to a more energetically favorable site for additional CO2 molecules, i.e., in stark contrast to typical behavior, sorbate intermolecular interactions enhance sorption energetics with increased loading. The simulated structure at CO2 saturation shows a loading with tight packing of 8 CO2 molecules per unit cell. The CO2 molecules can be seen alternating between a vertical and horizontal alignment within a channel, with each CO2 molecule coordinating to an equatorial fluorine MOM atom. Calculated H2 sorption isotherms and Qst values were also in good agreement with the experimental measurements in [Cu(dpa)2SiF6-i]. H2 saturation corresponds to 10 H2 molecules per unit cell for the studied structure. Moreover, there were two observed binding sites for hydrogen sorption in [Cu(dpa)2SiF6-i]. Simulations of a 30:70 CO2/H2 mixture, typical of syngas, in [Cu(dpa)2SiF6-i] showed that the MOM exhibited a high uptake and selectivity for CO2. In addition, it was observed that the presence of H2O had a negligible effect on the CO2 uptake and selectivity in [Cu(dpa)2SiF6-i], as simulations of a mixture containing CO2, H2, and small amounts of CO, N2, and H2O produced comparable results to the binary mixture simulations.",

    "abstract": "Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of CO2 sorption and separation were performed in [Zn(pyz)2SiF6], a metal\u2013organic material (MOM) consisting of a square grid of Zn2+ ions coordinated to pyrazine (pyz) linkers and pillars of SiF62\u2013 ions. This MOM was recently shown to have an unprecedented selectivity for CO2 over N2, CH4, and H2 under industrially relevant conditions. The simulated CO2 sorption isotherms and calculated isosteric heat of adsorption, Qst, values were in excellent agreement with the experimental data for all the state points considered. CO2 saturation in [Zn(pyz)2SiF6] was achieved at near-ambient temperatures and pressures lower than 1.0 atm. Moreover, the sorbed CO2 molecules were representative of a liquid/fluid under such conditions as confirmed through calculating the isothermal compressibility, \u03b2T, values. The simulated CO2 uptakes within CO2/N2 (10:90), CO2/CH4 (50:50), and CO2/H2 (30:70) mixture compositions, characteristic of flue gas, biogas, and syngas, respectively, were comparable to those that were produced in the single-component CO2 sorption simulations. The modeled structure at saturation revealed a loading of 1 CO2 molecule per unit cell. The favored CO2 sorption site was identified as the attraction of the carbon atoms of CO2 molecules to four equatorial fluorine atoms of SiF62\u2013 anions simultaneously, resulting in CO2 molecules localized at the center of the channel. Furthermore, experimental studies have shown that [Zn(pyz)2SiF6] sorbed minimal amounts of CO2 and N2 at their respective liquid temperatures. Analysis of the crystal structure at 100 K revealed that the unit cell undergoes a slight contraction in all dimensions and contains pyrazine rings that are mildly slanted with an angle of 13.9\u00b0. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the sorbate molecules are anchored to the framework at low temperatures, which inhibits diffusion. Thus, it is hypothesized that the sorbed molecules become trapped in the pores and block other sorbate molecules from entering the MOM at low temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Potential energy functions including many-body polarization are in widespread use in simulations of aqueous and biological systems, metal-organics, molecular clusters, and other systems where electronically induced redistribution of charge among local atomic sites is of importance. The polarization interactions, treated here via the methods of Thole and Applequist, while long-ranged, can be computed for moderate-sized periodic systems with extremely high accuracy by extending Ewald summation to the induced fields as demonstrated by Nymand, Sala, and others. These full Ewald polarization calculations, however, are expensive and often limited to very small systems, particularly in Monte Carlo simulations, which may require energy evaluation over several hundred-thousand configurations. For such situations, it shall be shown that sufficiently accurate computation of the polarization energy can be produced in a fraction of the central processing unit (CPU) time by neglecting the long-range extension to the induced fields while applying the long-range treatments of Ewald or Wolf to the static fields; these methods, denoted Ewald E-Static and Wolf E-Static (WES), respectively, provide an effective means to obtain polarization energies for intermediate and large systems including those with several thousand polarizable sites in a fraction of the CPU time. Furthermore, we shall demonstrate a means to optimize the damping for WES calculations via extrapolation from smaller trial systems.",

    "abstract": "A polarizable and transferable intermolecular potential energy function, potentials with high accuracy, speed, and transferability (PHAST), has been developed from first principles for molecular nitrogen to be used in the modeling of heterogeneous processes such as materials sorption and separations. A five-site (van der Waals and point charge) anisotropic model, that includes many-body polarization, is proposed. It is parametrized to reproduce high-level electronic structure calculations (CCSD(T) using Dunning-type basis sets extrapolated to the CBS limit) for a representative set of dimer potential energy curves. Thus it provides a relatively simple yet robust and broadly applicable representation of nitrogen. Two versions are developed, differing by the type of mixing rules applied to unlike Lennard-Jones potential sites. It is shown that the Waldman\u2013Hagler mixing rules are more accurate than Lorentz\u2013Berthelot. The resulting potentials are demonstrated to be effective in modeling neat nitrogen but are designed to also be useful in modeling N2 interactions in a large array of environments such as metal\u2013organic frameworks and zeolites and at interfaces. In such settings, capturing anisotropic forces and interactions with (open and coordinated) metals and charged/polar environments is essential. In developing the potential, it was found that adding a seemingly redundant dimer orientation, slip-parallel (S), improved the transferability of the potential energy surface (PES). Notably, one of the solid phases of nitrogen was not as accurately represented energetically without including S in the representative set. Liquid simulations, however, were unaffected and worked equally well for both potentials. This suggests that accounting for a wide variety of configurations is critical in designing a potential that is intended for use in heterogeneous environments where many orientations, including those not commonly explored in the bulk, are possible. Testing and validation of the potential are achieved via simulations of a thermal distribution of trimer geometries compared to analogous high level electronic structure calculations and molecular simulations of bulk pressure\u2013density isotherms across the vapor, supercritical, and liquid phases. Crystal lattice parameters and energetics of the \u03b1-N2 and \u03b3-N2 solid phases are also evaluated and determined to be in good agreement with experiment. Thus the proposed potential is shown to be efficacious for gas, liquid, and solid use, representing both disordered and ordered configurations.",

    "abstract": "We develop a nonempirical atoms-in-molecules (AIM) method for computing net atomic charges that simultaneously reproduce chemical states of atoms in a material and the electrostatic potential V(r) outside its electron distribution. This method gives accurate results for a variety of periodic and nonperiodic materials including molecular systems, solid surfaces, porous solids, and nonporous solids. This method, called DDEC/c3, improves upon our previously published DDEC/c2 method (Manz, T. A.; Sholl, D. S. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2010, 6, 2455-2468) by accurately treating nonporous solids with short bond lengths. Starting with the theory all AIM charge partitioning functionals with spherically symmetric atomic weights must satisfy, the form of the DDEC/c3 functional is derived from first principles. The method is designed to converge robustly by avoiding conditions that lead to nearly flat optimization landscapes. In addition to net atomic charges, the method can also compute atomic multipoles and atomic spin moments. Calculations performed on a variety of systems demonstrate the method\u2019s accuracy, computational efficiency, and good agreement with available experimental data. Comparisons to a variety of other charge assignment methods (Bader, natural population analysis, electrostatic potential fitting, Hirshfeld, iterative Hirshfeld, and iterative stockholder atoms) show that the DDEC/c3 net atomic charges are well-suited for constructing flexible force-fields for atomistic simulations.",

    "abstract": "DFT and CASSCF calculations for the cyclization of (3Z)-cyclodec-3-en-1,5-diyne were carried out to investigate heavy-atom tunneling. At 37 degrees C, tunneling was computed to enhance the rate by 38-40% over the transition-state theory rate. Intramolecular C-12/C-13 kinetic isotope effects were predicted to be substantial, with a steep temperature dependence. These results are discussed in relation to recent experimental findings that show heavy-atom tunneling at moderate temperatures. The calculations point to the possibility of a simple computational test for the likelihood of heavy-atom tunneling using standard quantum-chemical information.",

    "abstract": "Massive stars provide feedback that shapes the interstellar medium of galaxies at all redshifts and their resulting stellar populations. Here we present three adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamics simulations that illustrate the impact of momentum transfer from ionizing radiation to the absorbing gas on star formation in high-redshift dwarf galaxies. Momentum transfer is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation with a ray-tracing algorithm that is adaptive in spatial and angular coordinates. We find that momentum input partially affects star formation by increasing the turbulent support to a three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circular velocity of early haloes. Compared to a calculation that neglects radiation pressure, the star formation rate is decreased by a factor of 5 to 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22122\u2009M\u2299\u2009yr\u22121 in a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter and stellar mass of 2.0 \u00d7 108 and 4.5 \u00d7 105\u2009M\u2299, respectively, when radiation pressure is included. Its mean metallicity of 10\u22122.1\u2009Z\u2299 is consistent with the observed dwarf galaxy luminosity\u2013metallicity relation. However, one may naively expect from the calculation without radiation pressure that the central region of the galaxy overcools and produces a compact, metal-rich stellar population with an average metallicity of 0.3\u2009Z\u2299, indicative of an incorrect physical recipe. In addition to photoheating in H\u2009ii regions, radiation pressure further drives dense gas from star-forming regions, so supernova feedback occurs in a warmer and more diffuse medium, launching metal-rich outflows. Capturing this aspect and a temporal separation between the start of radiative and supernova feedback are numerically important in the modelling of galaxies to avoid the \u2018overcooling problem\u2019. We estimate that dust in early low-mass galaxies is unlikely to aid in momentum transfer from radiation to the gas.",

    "abstract": "One of the principal targets in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapy is the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. Non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) are a class of highly specific drugs which bind to a pocket approximately 10 \u00c5 from the polymerase active site, inhibiting the enzyme allosterically. It is widely believed that NNRTIs function as \u201cmolecular wedges\u201d, disrupting the region between thumb and palm subdomains of the p66 subunit and locking the thumb in a wide-open conformation. Crystal structure data suggest that the binding of NNRTIs forces RT into a wide-open conformation in which the separation between the thumb and fingers subdomains is much higher than in the apo structure. Using ensemble molecular dynamics simulations (aggregate sampling 600 ns), we have captured RT bound to the NNRTI efavirenz in a closed conformation similar to that of the apo enzyme, suggesting the constraint of thumb motion is not as complete as previously believed. Rather, our investigation confirms that a conformational distribution across open and closed states must exist in the drug-bound enzyme and that allosteric modulation is effected via the alteration of the kinetic landscape of conformational transitions upon drug-binding. A more detailed understanding of the mechanism of NNRTI inhibition and the effect of binding upon domain motion could aid the design of more effective inhibitors and help identify novel allosteric sites.",

    "abstract": "By taking advantage of the tensor nature of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), we track trajectories of the linker molecule and a CO molecule chemisorbed at the hot spot of a nano-dumbbell consisting of dibenzyldithio-linked silver nanospheres. The linear Stark shift of CO serves as an absolute gauge of the local field, while the polyatomic spectra characterize the vector components of the local field. We identify surface-enhanced Raman optical activity due to a transient asperity in the nanojunction in an otherwise uneventful SERS trajectory. During fusion of the spheres, we observe sequential evolution of the enhanced spectra from dipole-coupled Raman to quadrupole- and magnetic dipole-coupled Raman, followed by a transition from line spectra to band spectra, and the full reversal of the sequence. From the spectrum of CO, the sequence can be understood to track the evolution of the junction plasmon resonance from dipolar to quadrupolar to charge transfer as a function of intersphere separation, which evolves at a speed of 1 \u00c5/min. The crossover to the conduction limit is marked by the transition of line spectra to Stark-broadened and shifted band spectra. As the junction closes on CO, the local field reaches 1 V/\u00c5, limited to a current of 1 electron per vibrational cycle passing through the molecule, with associated Raman enhancement factor via the charge transfer plasmon resonance of 1012. The local field identifies that a sharp protrusion is responsible for room-temperature chemisorption of CO on silver. The asymmetric phototunneling junction, Ag\u2013CO\u2013Ag, driven by the frequency-tunable charge transfer plasmon of the dumbbell antenna, combines the design elements of an ideal rectifying photocollector.",

    "abstract": "We present a technique to fit C^2 continuous parametric surfaces to scattered geometric data points forming frontiers delimiting physiologic structures in segmented images. Such mathematical representation is interesting because facilitates a large number of operations in modeling. While the fitting of C^2 continuous parametric curves to scattered geometric data points is quite trivial, the fitting of C^2 continuous parametric surfaces is not. The difficulty comes from the fact that each scattered data point should be assigned a unique parametric coordinate, and the fit is quite sensitive to their distribution on the parametric plane. We present a new approach where a polygonal (quadrilateral or triangular) surface is extracted from the segmented image. This surface is subsequently projected onto a parametric plane in a manner to insure a one-to-one mapping. The resulting polygonal mesh is then regularized for area and edge length. Finally, from this point surface fitting is relatively trivial. The novelty of our approach lies in the regularization of the polygonal mesh. Process performance is assessed with the reconstruction of a geometric model of a mouse heart ventricles from a computerized tomography scan. Our results show and excellent reproduction of the geometric data with surfaces that are $C^2$ continuous.",

    "abstract": "A family of sharp-interface immersed boundary methods using the so-called \u201cdirect forcing\u201d approach have been developed for a range of applications because of their simple formulation and relative ease in handling complex geometries. Numerical interpolations are typically adopted in these methods to approximate the flow variables at the grid points near the solid surface, which provides an implicit force in the flow so that the no-slip and no-penetration conditions are satisfied. When dealing with moving boundaries, however, these methods could be prone to numerical oscillations because the nodal points where the direct forcing is applied may change from one time step to next. Noticing that the oscillations are caused by the instantaneous change of the numerical description at the direct-forcing points, we propose a formulation that allows for a smooth transition of the numerical description at these points. This new formulation preserves the spatial accuracy of the original immersed-boundary formulation and can effectively suppress the force oscillations. In this paper, we present a specific example of such formulation in both two- and three-dimensions and validate the implementation for both fixed and moving boundaries. Finally, a full-body simulation of flapping flight is demonstrated using the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The geometry of two-dimensional crystalline membranes dictates their mechanical, electronic, and chemical properties. The local geometry of a surface is determined from the two invariants of the metric and the curvature tensors. Here we discuss those invariants directly from atomic positions in terms of angles, areas, and vertex and normal vectors from carbon atoms on the graphene lattice, for arbitrary elastic regimes and atomic conformations, and without recourse to an effective continuum model. The geometrical analysis of graphene membranes under mechanical load is complemented with a study of the local density of states (LDOS), discrete induced gauge potentials, velocity renormalization, and nontrivial electronic effects originating from the scalar deformation potential. The asymmetric LDOS is related to sublattice-specific deformation potential differences, giving rise to the pseudomagnetic field. The results here enable the study of geometrical, mechanical, and electronic properties for arbitrarily shaped graphene membranes in experimentally relevant regimes without recourse to differential geometry and continuum elasticity.",

    "abstract": "We present an inversion of the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley formalism to estimate initial conditions and model parameters, including functions of voltage, from the so- lutions of the underlying ordinary differential equation (ODE) subjected to multiple voltage step stimulations. As such, the procedure constitutes a means to estimate the parameters including functions of voltage of an Hodgkin\u2013Huxley formalism from experimental data. The basic idea was developed in a previous communication (SIAM J. Appl. Math. 64:1264\u20131274, 2009). The inversion in question applies to currents exhibiting acti- vation and inactivation, but the version, as published previously, cannot estimate the unknowns for channels that rapidly inactivate just after a brief opening. In such cases, the amplitude of the current, in a given voltage range, is too small to be detectable by the instrumentation using previously applied experimental protocols. This is, for ex- ample, the case for the sodium channels in a number of excitable tissue for potential in the vicinity of the cell resting potential. The current communication extends the inversion procedure in a manner to overcome this limitation. Furthermore, within the inversion framework, we can determine whether the data at the basis of the estimation sufficiently constrains the estimation problem, i.e., whether it is complete. We exploit this element of our method to document a set of stimulation protocols that constitute a complete data set for the purpose of inverting the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley formalism.",

    "abstract": "When flat or on a firm mechanical substrate, the atomic composition and atomistic structure of two-dimensional crystals dictate their chemical, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. These properties change when the two-dimensional and ideal crystal structure evolves into arbitrary shapes, providing a direct and dramatic link among geometry and material properties due to the larger structural flexibility when compared to bulk three-dimensional materials. We describe methods to understand the local geometrical information of two-dimensional conformal crystals quantitatively and directly from atomic positions, even in the presence of atomistic defects. We then discuss direct relations among the discrete geometry and chemically relevant quantities\u2014mean bond lengths, hybridization angles, and \u03c3\u2013\u03c0 hybridization. These concepts are illustrated for carbon-based materials and ionic crystals. The pyramidalization angle turns out to be linearly proportional to the mean curvature for relevant crystalline configurations. Discrete geometry provides direct quantitative information on the potential chemistry of conformal two-dimensional crystals.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of geologic realism into numerical models of subduction is becoming increasingly necessary as observational and experimental constraints indicate plate boundaries are inherently three-dimensional (3D) in nature and contain large viscosity variations. However, large viscosity variations occurring over short distances pose a challenge for computational codes, and models with complex 3D geometries require substantially greater numbers of elements, increasing the computational demands. We modified a community mantle convection code, CitcomCU, to model realistic subduction zones that use an arbitrarily shaped 3D plate boundary interface and incorporate the effects of a strain-rate dependent viscosity based on an experimentally derived flow law for olivine aggregates. Tests of this implementation on 3D models with a simple subduction zone geometry indicate that limiting the overall viscosity range in the model, as well as limiting the viscosity jump across an element, improves model runtime and convergence behavior, consistent with what has been shown previously. In addition, the choice of method and averaging scheme used to transfer the viscosity structure to the different levels in the multigrid solver can significantly improve model performance. These optimizations can improve model runtime by over 20%. 3D models of a subduction zone with a complex plate boundary geometry were then constructed, containing over 100 million finite element nodes with a local resolution of up to 2.35 km, and run on XSEDE. These complex 3D models, representative of the Alaska subduction zone-transform plate boundary, contain viscosity variations of up to seven orders of magnitude. The optimizations in solver parameters determined from the simple 3D models of subduction applied to the much larger and more complex models of an actual subduction zone improved model convergence behavior and reduced runtimes by on the order of 25%. One scientific result from 3D models of Alaska is that a laterally variable mantle viscosity emerges in the mantle as a consequence of variations in the flow field, with localized velocities of greater than 80 cm/yr occurring close to the subduction zone where the negative buoyancy of the slab drives the flow. These results are a significant departure from the paradigm of two-dimensional (2D) models of subduction where the slab velocity is often fixed to surface plate motion. While the solver parameter optimization can improve model performance, the results also demonstrate the need for new solvers to keep pace with the demands for increasingly complex numerical simulations in mantle convection.",

    "abstract": "I/O performance is vital for most HPC applications especially those that generate a vast amount of data with the growth of scale. Many studies have shown that scientific applications tend to issue small and noncontiguous accesses in an interleaving fashion, causing different processes to access overlapping regions. In such scenario, collective I/O is a widely used optimization technique. However, the use of collective I/O deployed in existing MPI implementations is not trivial and sometimes even impossible. Collective I/O is an optimization based on a single collective I/O access. If the data reside in different places (e.g. in different arrays), the application has to maintain a buffer to first combine these data and then perform I/O operations on the buffer rather than the original data pieces. The process is very tedious for application developers. Besides, collective I/O requires the creating of a file view to describe the noncontiguous access patterns and additional coding is needed. Moreover, for the applications with complex data access using dynamic data sizes, it is hard or even impossible to use the file view mechanism to describe the access pattern through derived data types. In this study, we develop a user-level library called transparent collective I/O (TCIO) for application developers to easily incorporate collective I/O optimization into their applications. Preliminary experiments by means of a synthetic benchmark and a real cosmology application demonstrate that the library can significantly reduce the programming efforts required for application developers. Moreover, TCIO delivers better performance at large scales as compared to the existing collective functionality provided by MPI-IO.",

This effort was launched to refine and revise a legacy system and more than 15 years\u2019 worth of incremental improvements; to better integrate and position the allocations service within the XSEDE infrastructure; and to help streamline the allocations processes across a broader set of cyberinfrastructure investments. Because the allocation processes for most high-performance computing providers are typically variations on a common high-level approach, XRAS can deliver allocations software-as-a-service through a set of common tools and interfaces enhanced by flexible mechanisms that allow clients to tailor the environment to meet the needs of their process. By offering such a service to the eScience community, we can leverage the unique expertise of the XSEDE team and expand opportunities for open science by sharing the interfaces needed to manage resource allocations for both large and small institutions.",

    "abstract": "Early theories of plate tectonics assumed plates were rigid with deformation limited to within a few tens of kilometers of the plate boundary. However, observations indicate most continental plates defy such rigid behavior with deformation extending over 1000 kilometers inboard. We construct three-dimensional (3D) numerical models of the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates in Alaska to investigate the relative controls of flat slab subduction, continental scale faulting, and a non-linear rheology on deformation in the overriding plate. The models incorporate a realistic slab shape based on seismicity and seismic tomography and a variable thermal structure for both the subducting and overriding plates based on geologic and geophysical observables. The inclusion of the Denali fault in the models allows for the portion of south-central Alaska between the Denali fault and the trench to partially decouple from the rest of North America, forming an independently moving region that correlates to what has been described from geologic and geodetic studies as the Wrangell block. The motion of the Wrangell block tracks the motion of the flat slab in the subsurface indicating the subducting plate is driving the motion of the Wrangell block. Models using a composite (Newtonian and non-Newtonian) viscosity predict compressional motion along the northern bend in the Denali fault, consistent with thermochronologic data that show significant late Neogene exhumation in the central Alaska Range, including at Mt. McKinley, the tallest mountain in North America. These 3D numerical models of the Pacific\u2013North American margin in Alaska show the subducting slab is the main driver of overriding plate deformation in south-central Alaska and combined with the Denali fault can reproduce several first order tectonic features of the region including the motion of the Wrangell block, uplift in the central Alaska Range, subsidence in the Cook Inlet-Susitna Basins, and upwelling at the slab edge beneath the Wrangell volcanics.",

    "abstract": "The term \"campus bridging\" was first used in the charge given to an NSF Advisory Committee for Cyberinfrastructure task force. That task force developed this description of campus bridging: \"Campus bridging is the seamlessly integrated use of cyberinfrastructure operated by a scientist or engineer with other cyberinfrastructure on the scientist's campus, at other campuses, and at the regional, national, and international levels as if they were proximate to the scientist, and when working within the context of a Virtual Organization (VO) make the 'virtual' aspect of the organization irrelevant (or helpful) to the work of the VO.\" Campus bridging is more a viewpoint and a set of approaches to usability, software, and information concerns than a particular set of tools or software. We outline here several specific use cases that have been identified as priorities for XSEDE in the next four years. These priorities include documentation, deployment of software used entirely outside of XSEDE, and software that helps bridge from individual researcher to campus to XSEDE cyberinfrastructure. We also describe early pilot tests and means by which the user community may stay informed of campus bridging activities and participate in the implementation of Campus Bridging tools created by XSEDE. Metrics are still being developed, and will include (1) the number of campuses that adopt and use Campus Bridging tools developed by XSEDE and (2) the number of and extent to which XSEDE-developed Campus Bridging tools are adopted among other CI projects.",

    "abstract": "As science becomes more computation and data intensive, computing needs often exceed campus capacity. Thus we see a desire to scale from the local environment to other campuses, to national cyberinfrastructure providers such as XSEDE, and/or to cloud providers---in other words, to \"bridge\" to the wider world. But given the realities of limited resources, time, and expertise, campus bridging methods must be exceedingly easy to use: as easy, for example, as are Netflix and Amazon movie streaming services. We report here on experiences with a service called Globus Online, which seeks to do for campus bridging what Netflix and Amazon do for movies: that is, use powerful cloud-hosted services and simple, intuitive web interfaces to make it \"so easy that your grandparent can do it.\" Specifically, we describe Globus Transfer, which addresses the important campus bridging use case of moving or synchronizing data across institutional boundaries. We describe how Globus Transfer achieves both ease of use for researchers and ease of administration for campus IT staff. We provide technical details on the Globus solution; quantitative data on usage by more than 25 early adopter campuses; and experience reports from two early adopters, the University of Michigan and the University of Colorado Boulder.",

    "abstract": "High-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy is a non-destructive materials characterization technique that is capable of tracking the evolution of three dimensional microstructures as they respond to external stimuli. We present measurements of the annealing response of high-purity aluminum using the near-field variant of this technique. The data are analyzed with the forward modeling method which produces orientation maps that exhibit complex intragranular structures. Analysis and verification of results use both reconstructed sample space maps and detector space intensity patterns. Sensitivity to the ordering of the microstructure through both recovery and recrystallization is demonstrated. Sharpening of diffraction peaks and a corresponding reduction in intragranular orientation variations signal recovery processes. The emergence of a new bulk grain (recrystallization) is observed in a disordered region of the microstructure; the new grain has an orientation with no obvious relation to those of grains surrounding the disordered region.",

Science 2007; 318:1276\u20131279] have demonstrated spontaneous end-to-end association of short duplex DNA fragments into long rod-like structures. By means of extensive all-atom molecular dynamic simulations, we characterized end-to-end interactions of duplex DNA, quantitatively describing the forces, free energy and kinetics of the end-to-end association process. We found short DNA duplexes to spontaneously aggregate end-to-end when axially aligned in a small volume of monovalent electrolyte. It was observed that electrostatic repulsion of 5\u2032-phosphoryl groups promoted the formation of aggregates in a conformation similar to the B-form DNA double helix. Application of an external force revealed that rupture of the end-to-end assembly occurs by the shearing of the terminal base pairs. The standard binding free energy and the kinetic rates of end-to-end association and dissociation processes were estimated using two complementary methods: umbrella sampling simulations of two DNA fragments and direct observation of the aggregation process in a system containing 458 DNA fragments. We found the end-to-end force to be short range, attractive, hydrophobic and only weakly dependent on the ion concentration. The relation between the stacking free energy and end-to-end attraction is discussed as well as possible roles of the end-to-end interaction in biological and nanotechnological systems.",

    "abstract": "The structural and electronic properties of a photochromic molecule dictate their potential photochemical activity. To gain insight into these influences, the ground-state structure and excited state properties of six indolylgulgides were calculated using several time dependent-density functional theory (DFT) (TD-DFT)//DFT methods, second-order M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset (MP2), and CIS(D). These methods simulated the charge-transfer properties and the conformation of the ground-state structure for each molecule. Generally, TD-DFT accurately simulated the expected charge-transfer state. The degree of spatial overlap of the occupied and virtual molecular orbitals involved in the S1 transition of indolylfulgides quantitatively assessed their charge-transfer character and was qualitatively useful in assessing their photochromic activity. The M06, M06-2X, and M11 structures were quite similar to those calculated by MP2. Structural differences, similarities, and functional trends are compared and discussed. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The origin of the Steens\u2013Columbia River (SCR) flood basalts, which is presumed to be the onset of Yellowstone volcanism, has remained controversial, with the proposed conceptual models involving either a mantle plume1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or back-arc processes6, 7, 8. Recent tomographic inversions based on the USArray data reveal unprecedented detail of upper-mantle structures of the western USA9 and tightly constrain geodynamic models simulating Farallon subduction, which has been proposed to influence the Yellowstone volcanism5, 6. Here we show that the best-fitting geodynamic model10 depicts an episode of slab tearing about 17\u2009million years ago under eastern Oregon, where an associated sub-slab asthenospheric upwelling thermally erodes the Farallon slab, leading to formation of a slab gap at shallow depth. Driven by a gradient of dynamic pressure, the tear ruptured quickly north and south and within about two million years covering a distance of around 900\u2009kilometres along all of eastern Oregon and northern Nevada. This tear would be consistent with the occurrence of major volcanic dikes during the SCR\u2013Northern Nevada Rift flood basalt event both in space and time. The model predicts a petrogenetic sequence for the flood basalt with sources of melt starting from the base of the slab, at first remelting oceanic lithosphere and then evolving upwards, ending with remelting of oceanic crust. Such a progression helps to reconcile the existing controversies on the interpretation of SCR geochemistry and the involvement of the putative Yellowstone plume. Our study suggests a new mechanism for the formation of large igneous provinces.",

    "abstract": "In this article we highlight recent work in which we computed the spin unpolarized coherent electron transport through two terminal nanoscale graphene/metal junctions using equilibrium Green\u2019s functions coupled to Density functional theory, capturing in detail the important electronic effects created at metal/graphene interfaces. In those calculations the metal contacts may or may not bind covalently to graphene. Along the way, connections to other models for coherent transport on graphene junctions with metal contacts are given as well. As it may be known, the computation of the electronic dispersion at the interface between graphene and binding metals in a transport setup is extremely time-consuming, and it is perhaps for this reason that effects of metals are neglected or are captured only qualitatively in the theoretical and computational modeling of graphene devices. It thus seems to us that a methodology to go past this stumbling block may be well-received. We outline an approach to obtain tight-binding parameters describing the electronic dispersion at interfaces between titanium leads and graphene. The deployment of those tight-binding parameters is new, and it constitutes the main contribution on the present paper.",

    "abstract": "Comparisons of the integrated thermal pressure support of gas against its gravitational potential energy lead to critical mass scales for gravitational instability such as the Jeans and the Bonnor\u2013Ebert masses, which play an important role in the analysis of many physical systems, including the heuristics of numerical simulations. In a strict theoretical sense, however, neither the Jeans nor the Bonnor\u2013Ebert mass is meaningful when applied locally to substructure in a self-gravitating turbulent medium. For this reason, we investigate the local support by thermal pressure, turbulence and magnetic fields against gravitational compression through an approach that is independent of these concepts. At the centre of our approach is the dynamical equation for the divergence of the velocity field. We carry out a statistical analysis of the source terms of the local compression rate (the negative time derivative of the divergence) for simulations of forced self-gravitating turbulence in periodic boxes with zero, weak and moderately strong mean magnetic fields (measured by the averages of the magnetic and thermal pressures). We also consider the amplification of the magnetic field energy by shear and by compression. Thereby, we are able to demonstrate that the support against gravity is dominated by thermal pressure fluctuations, although magnetic pressure also yields a significant contribution. The net effect of turbulence in the highly supersonic regime, however, is to enhance compression rather than supporting overdense gas even if the vorticity is very high. This is incommensurate with the support of the highly dynamical substructures in magnetoturbulent fluids being determined by local virial equilibria of volume energies without surface stresses.",

    "abstract": "There are two primary aerodynamic noise generation mechanisms in a horizontal axis wind turbine: (1) due to turbulence in incoming flow scattering from the leading edges of rotor blades, and (2) due to turbulence self generated by the rotor blades (in boundary layers) scattering from trailing edges. Prediction of noise from the first mechanism is targeted here. The current paper however limits its focus to report findings on a model problem. In this problem, the turbulence is generated by wake shedding from a cylinder and its interaction with NACA 0012 airfoil (placed in tandem) is investigated. The noise prediction procedure is a two-step process: time accurate data is first collected from LES simulations on a surface enclosing the noise producing regions (in this case the rod and the airfoil). An integral equation (Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings) is then solved to obtain the acoustic pressures in the farfield.",

We attribute the observed vibrational state-specific blinking events to conformational changes in mtpp, namely, torsional flexibility which mediates the coupling between the pi-framework of the meso-phenyls and the underlying metal substrate.",

    "abstract": "Factor VIII (FVIII) is the blood coagulation protein when defective or deficient causes for hemophilia A, a severe hereditary bleeding disorder. Activated FVIII (FVIIIa) is the co-factor to the serine protease Factor IXa (FIXa) within the membrane-bound Tenase complex, responsible for amplifying its proteolytic activity more than 100,000 times, necessary for normal clot formation. FVIII is composed of two non-covalently linked peptide chains: a light chain holding the membrane interaction sites and a heavy chain holding the main FIXa interaction sites. The interplay between the light and heavy chains in the membrane-bound state is critical for the biological efficiency of FVIII. Here, we present our Cryo-electron microscopy and structure analysis studies of human FVIII light chain, as helically assembled onto negatively charged single lipid bilayer nanotubes. The resolved FVIII light chain membrane-bound structure supports aspects of our previously proposed FVIII structure from membrane-bound two-dimensional (2D) crystals, such as only the C2 domain interacts directly with the membrane. The light chain is oriented differently in the FVIII membrane-bound helical and 2D crystal structures based on electron microscopy data, and the existing X-ray structures. This flexibility of the FVIII-light chain domain organization in different states is discussed in the light of the FVIIIa-FIXa complex assembly and function.",

    "abstract": "Cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data of the interior of phages show ordering of the interior DNA that has been interpreted as a nearly perfectly ordered polymer. We show surface-induced correlations, excluded volume, and electrostatic forces are sufficient to predict most of the major features of the current structural data for DNA packaged within viral capsids without additional ordering due to elastic bending forces for the polymer. Current models assume highly-ordered, even spooled, hexagonally packed conformations based on interpretation of cryo-EM density maps. We show herein that the surface induced packing of short (6mer), unconnected DNA polymer segments is the only necessary ingredient in creating ringed densities consistent with experimental density maps. This implies the ensemble of possible conformations of polymeric DNA within the capsid that are consistent with cryo-EM data may be much larger than implied by traditional interpretations where such rings can only result from highly-ordered spool-like conformations. This opens the possibility of a more disordered, entropically-driven view of phage packaging thermodynamics. We also show the electrostatics of the DNA contributes a large portion of the internal hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of a phage virion, suggesting that nonlinear elastic anomalies might reduce the overall elastic bending enthalpy of more disordered conformations to have allowable free energies.",

    "abstract": "Standard puncture initial data have been widely used for numerical binary black hole evolutions despite their shortcomings, most notably the inherent lack of gravitational radiation at the initial time that is later followed by a burst of spurious radiation. We study the evolution of three alternative initial data schemes. Two of the three alternatives are based on post-Newtonian expansions that contain realistic gravitational waves. The first scheme is based on a second-order post-Newtonian expansion in Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner transverse-traceless (ADMTT) gauge that has been resummed to approach standard puncture data at the black holes. The second scheme is based on asymptotic matching of the 4-metrics of two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild solutions to a first-order post-Newtonian expansion in ADMTT gauge away from the black holes. The final alternative is obtained through asymptotic matching of the 4-metrics of two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild solutions to a second-order post-Newtonian expansion in harmonic gauge away from the black holes. When evolved, the second scheme fails to produce quasicircular orbits (and instead leads to a nearly head-on collision). This failure can be traced back to inaccuracies in the extrinsic curvature due to low order matching. More encouraging is that the latter two alternatives lead to quasicircular orbits and show gravitational radiation from the onset of the evolution, as well as a reduction of spurious radiation. Current deficiencies compared to standard punctures data include more eccentric trajectories during the inspiral and larger constraint violations, since the alternative data sets are only approximate solutions of Einstein's equations. The eccentricity problem can be ameliorated by adjusting the initial momentum parameters.",

    "abstract": "We present an extensible interface between the AMBER molec- ular dynamics (MD) software package and electronic structure software packages for quantum mechanical (QM) and mixed QM and classical molecular mechanical (MM) MD simulations within both mechanical and electronic embedding schemes. With this interface, ab initio wave function theory and density functional theory methods, as available in the supported elec- tronic structure software packages, become available for QM/ MM MD simulations with AMBER. The interface has been writ- ten in a modular fashion that allows straight forward exten- sions to support additional QM software packages and can easily be ported to other MD software. Data exchange between the MD and QM software is implemented by means of files and system calls or the message passing interface standard. Based on extensive tests, default settings for the supported QM packages are provided such that energy is con- served for typical QM/MM MD simulations in the microcanoni- cal ensemble. Results for the free energy of binding of calcium ions to aspartate in aqueous solution comparing semiempirical and density functional Hamiltonians are shown to demonstrate features of this interface.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Reactions of laser-ablated U atoms with N2 molecules upon co-deposition in excess argon or neon at 4 K gave intense NUN and weak UN absorptions. Annealing produced progressions of new absorptions for the UN2(N2)1,2,3,4,5 and UN(N2)1,2,3,4,5,6 complexes. The neon to argon matrix shift decreases with increasing NN ligation and therefore the number of noble gas atoms left in the primary coordination sphere around the NUN molecule. Small matrix shifts are observed when the secondary coordination layer around the primary UN2(N2)1,2,3,4,5 and UN(N2)1,2,3,4,5,6 complexes are changed from neon to argon to nitrogen. Electronic structure, energy and frequency calculations have been done to support the experimental assignments.",

    "abstract": "We present an innovative method to perform multi-scale finite element analyses of the cortical component of the femur using the individual's 1] computed tomography scan; and 2] a bone specimen obtained in conjunction with orthopedic surgery. The method enables study of micro-structural characteristics regulating strains and stresses under physiological loading conditions. The analysis of the micro-structural scenarios that cause variation of strain and stress is the first step in understanding the elevated strains and stresses in bone tissue, which are indicative of higher likelihood of micro-crack formation in bone, implicated in consequent remodeling or macroscopic bone fracture. Evidence that micro-structure varies with clinical history and contributes in significant, but poorly understood, ways to bone function, motivates the method\u2019s development, as does need for software tools to investigate relationships between macroscopic loading and micro-structure. Three applications \u2013 varying region of interest, bone mineral density, and orientation of collagen type I, illustrate the method. We show, in comparison between physiological loading and simple compression of a patient\u2019s femur, that strains computed at the multi-scale model\u2019s micro-level: i] differ; and ii] depend on local collagen-apatite orientation and degree of calcification. Our findings confirm the strain concentration role of osteocyte lacunae, important for mechano-transduction.

    "abstract": "Multivalency is a powerful strategy for achieving high-affinity molecular binding of compounds to increase their therapeutic potency or imaging potential. In our study, multivalent non-peptide integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 antagonists (IA) were designed for antitumor therapy. Docking and molecular dynamics were employed to explore the binding modes of IA monomer, dimer, and trimer. In silico, one IA unit binds tightly in the active site with similar pose to native ligand RGD and other parts of dimer and trimer contribute extra binding affinities by interacting with residues in vicinity of the original site. In vitro studies demonstrated that increasing valency results in increasing antiproliferative and antiorganizational effects against endothelial cells (HUVECs), and a much weaker effect on melanoma B16F10 cells. The antitumor efficacies of the IA multivalent compounds were evaluated in subcutaneous B16F10 melanoma tumor-bearing mice.

    "abstract": "Background Subtypes are widely found in cancer. They are characterized with different behaviors in clinical and molecular profiles, such as survival rates, gene signature and copy number aberrations (CNAs). While cancer is generally believed to have been caused by genetic aberrations, the number of such events is tremendous in the cancer tissue and only a small subset of them may be tumorigenic. On the other hand, gene expression signature of a subtype represents residuals of the subtype-specific cancer mechanisms. Using high-throughput data to link these factors to define subtype boundaries and identify subtype-specific drivers, is a promising yet largely unexplored topic. Results We report a systematic method to automate the identification of cancer subtypes and candidate drivers. Specifically, we propose an iterative algorithm that alternates between gene expression clustering and gene signature selection. We applied the method to datasets of the pediatric cerebellar tumor medulloblastoma (MB). The subtyping algorithm consistently converges on multiple datasets of medulloblastoma, and the converged signatures and copy number landscapes are also found to be highly reproducible across the datasets. Based on the identified subtypes, we developed a PCA-based approach for subtype-specific identification of cancer drivers. The top-ranked driver candidates are found to be enriched with known pathways in certain subtypes of MB. This might reveal new understandings for these subtypes. This article is an extended abstract of our ICCABS '12 paper (Chen et al. 2012), with revised methods in iterative subtyping, the use of canonical correlation analysis for driver-identification, and an extra dataset (Northcott90 dataset) for cross-validations. Discussions of the algorithm performance and of the slightly different gene lists identified are also added. Conclusions Our study indicates that subtype-signature defines the subtype boundaries, characterizes the subtype-specific processes and can be used to prioritize signature-related drivers.",

    "abstract": "Sodium/proton (Na+/H+) antiporters, located at the plasma membrane in every cell, are vital for cell homeostasis1. In humans, their dysfunction has been linked to diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure and epilepsy, and they are well-established drug targets2. The best understood model system for Na+/H+ antiport is NhaA from Escherichia coli1, 3, for which both electron microscopy and crystal structures are available4, 5, 6. NhaA is made up of two distinct domains: a core domain and a dimerization domain. In the NhaA crystal structure a cavity is located between the two domains, providing access to the ion-binding site from the inward-facing surface of the protein1, 4. Like many Na+/H+ antiporters, the activity of NhaA is regulated by pH, only becoming active above pH\u20096.5, at which point a conformational change is thought to occur7. The only reported NhaA crystal structure so far is of the low pH inactivated form4. Here we describe the active-state structure of a Na+/H+ antiporter, NapA from Thermus thermophilus, at 3\u2009\u00c5 resolution, solved from crystals grown at pH\u20097.8. In the NapA structure, the core and dimerization domains are in different positions to those seen in NhaA, and a negatively charged cavity has now opened to the outside. The extracellular cavity allows access to a strictly conserved aspartate residue thought to coordinate ion binding1, 8, 9 directly, a role supported here by molecular dynamics simulations. To alternate access to this ion-binding site, however, requires a surprisingly large rotation of the core domain, some 20$\\,^{\\circ}$ against the dimerization interface. We conclude that despite their fast transport rates of up to 1,500\u2009ions\u2009per second3, Na+/H+ antiporters operate by a two-domain rocking bundle model, revealing themes relevant to secondary-active transporters in general.",

    "abstract": "Using all-atom molecular dynamics and atomic-resolution Brownian dynamics, we simulate the translocation of single-stranded DNA through graphene nanopores and characterize the ionic current blockades produced by DNA nucleotides. We find that transport of single DNA strands through graphene nanopores may occur in single nucleotide steps. For certain pore geometries, hydrophobic interactions with the graphene membrane lead to a dramatic reduction in the conformational fluctuations of the nucleotides in the nanopores. Furthermore, we show that ionic current blockades produced by different DNA nucleotides are, in general, indicative of the nucleotide type, but very sensitive to the orientation of the nucleotides in the nanopore. Taken together, our simulations suggest that strand sequencing of DNA by measuring the ionic current blockades in graphene nanopores may be possible, given that the conformation of DNA nucleotides in the nanopore can be controlled through precise engineering of the nanopore surface.",

    "abstract": "Many problems of interest in modern science originate from the complex network of interactions of different molecular structures, each possessing its own typical length and time scale of relevance. In such materials, nontrivial properties emerge from the different length and time scales involved that could not be predicted from the properties of each individual subunit taken alone. A solution to the formidable theoretical and computational issues raised by these systems involves coarse-graining, a procedure in which multiple atoms are grouped into a few interaction sites. The coarse-grained approach aims at constructing an effective Hamiltonian from available information about the system and then using this Hamiltonian to investigate the behavior of the system on the length and time scales of interest. In this paper, we aim at determining how far we can coarse-grain a system using only the commonly used pairwise, spherically symmetric potentials, as well as assessing the impact of poor initial sampling on the quality of the resulting coarse-grained model. Coarse-graining is performed following the multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) methodology, and we use as a model system the N-methylacetamide (NMA) molecule, a simple representation of a peptide bond, which can adopt two conformations, cis and trans. Our simulations reveal that as the coarse-graining becomes more aggressive multibody effects start to emerge and that the initial sampling of conformations can adversely bias the model in the case of heavy coarse-graining.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid-\u03b2(25\u201335) peptide plays a key role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease due to its extreme toxicity even in the absence of aging. Because of its high tendency to aggregate and its low solubility in water, the structure of this peptide is still unknown. In this work, we sought to understand the early stages of aggregation of the amyloid-\u03b2(25\u201335) peptide by conducting simulations of oligomers ranging from monomers to tetramers. Our simulations show that although the monomer preferentially adopts a \u03b2-hairpin conformation, larger aggregates have extended structures, and a clear transition from compact \u03b2-hairpin conformations to extended \u03b2-strand structures occurs between dimers and trimers. Even though \u03b2-hairpins are not present in the final architecture of the fibril, our simulations indicate that they play a critical role in fibril growth. Our simulations also show that \u03b2-sheet structures are stabilized when a \u03b2-hairpin is present at the edge of the sheet. The binding of the hairpin to the sheet leads to a subsequent destabilization of the hairpin, with part of the hairpin backbone dangling in solution. This free section of the peptide can then recruit an extra monomer from solution, leading to further sheet extension. Our simulations indicate that the peptide must possess sufficient conformational flexibility to switch between a hairpin and an extended conformation in order for \u03b2-sheet extension to occur, and offer a rationalization for the experimental observation that overstabilizing a hairpin conformation in the monomeric state (for example, through chemical cross-linking) significantly hampers the fibrillization process.",

    "abstract": "Neutron stars (NSs) in the astrophysical universe are often surrounded by accretion disks. Accretion of matter onto an NS may increase its mass above the maximum value allowed by its equation of state, inducing its collapse to a black hole (BH). Here we study this process for the first time, in three-dimensions, and in full general relativity. By considering three initial NS configurations, each with and without a surrounding disk (of mass ~7% M_{NS}), we investigate the effect of the accretion disk on the dynamics of the collapse and its imprint on both the gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals that can be emitted by these sources. We show in particular that, even if the GW signal is similar for the accretion induced collapse (AIC) and the collapse of an NS in vacuum (and detectable only for Galactic sources), the EM counterpart could allow us to discriminate between these two types of events. In fact, our simulations show that, while the collapse of an NS in vacuum leaves no appreciable baryonic matter outside the event horizon, an AIC is followed by a phase of rapid accretion of the surviving disk onto the newly formed BH. The post-collapse accretion rates, on the order of ~10^{\u20132} M_sun s^{\u20131}, make these events tantalizing candidates as engines of short gamma-ray bursts.",

Although the ability of CTBs in strengthening, maintaining the ductility and minimizing the electron scattering is well documented [1, 2, 3], most of our understanding of the origin of these properties relies on perfect-interface assumptions. Here we report experiments and simulations demonstrating that as-grown CTBs in nanotwinned copper are inherently defective with kink-like steps and curvature, and that these imperfections consist of incoherent segments and partial dislocations. We further show that these defects play a crucial role in the deformation mechanisms and mechanical behaviour of nanotwinned copper. Our findings offer a view of the structure of CTBs that is largely different from that in the literature [2, 4, 5], and underscore the significance of imperfections in nanotwin-strengthened materials.",

    "abstract": "Macroscopic electroencephalographic (EEG) fields can be an explicit top-down neocortical mechanism that directly drives bottom-up processes that describe memory, attention, and other neuronal processes. The top-down mechanism considered is macrocolumnar EEG firings in neocortex, as described by a statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions (SMNI), developed as a magnetic vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$. The bottom-up process considered is $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves prominent in synaptic and extracellular processes that are considered to greatly influence neuronal firings. Here, the complimentary effects are considered, i.e., the influence of $\\mathbf{A}$ on $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ momentum, $\\mathbf{p}$. The canonical momentum of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, $\\mathbf{\\Pi} = \\mathbf{p} + q \\mathbf{A}$ (SI units), is calculated, where the charge of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is $q = - 2 e$, $e$ is the magnitude of the charge of an electron. Calculations demonstrate that macroscopic EEG $\\mathbf{A}$ can be quite influential on the momentum $\\mathbf{p}$ of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions, in both classical and quantum mechanics. Molecular scales of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ wave dynamics are coupled with $\\mathbf{A}$ fields developed at macroscopic regional scales measured by coherent neuronal firing activity measured by scalp EEG. The project has three main aspects: fitting $\\mathbf{A}$ models to EEG data as reported here, building tripartite models to develop $\\mathbf{A}$ models, and studying long coherence times of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves in the presence of $\\mathbf{A}$ due to coherent neuronal firings measured by scalp EEG. The SMNI model supports a mechanism wherein the $\\mathbf{p} + q \\mathbf{A}$ interaction at tripartite synapses, via a dynamic centering mechanism (DCM) to control background synaptic activity, acts to maintain short-term memory (STM) during states of selective attention.",

    "abstract": "Coalescing supermassive black hole binaries are produced by the mergers of galaxies and are the most powerful sources of gravitational waves accessible to space-based gravitational observatories. Some such mergers may occur in the presence of matter and magnetic fields and hence generate an electromagnetic counterpart. In this Letter, we present the first general relativistic simulations of magnetized plasma around merging supermassive black holes using the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code Whisky. By considering different magnetic field strengths, going from non-magnetically dominated to magnetically dominated regimes, we explore how magnetic fields affect the dynamics of the plasma and the possible emission of electromagnetic signals. In particular, we observe a total amplification of the magnetic field of ~2 orders of magnitude, which is driven by the accretion onto the binary and that leads to much stronger electromagnetic signals, more than a factor of 10^4 larger than comparable calculations done in the force-free regime where such amplifications are not possible.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce Force\ufb01eld_PTM, a set of AMBER force\ufb01eld parameters consistent with ff03 for 32 common post-translational modi\ufb01cations. Partial charges were calculated through ab initio calculations and a two-stage RESP-\ufb01tting procedure in an ether-like implicit solvent environment. The charges were found to be generally consistent with others previously reported for phosphorylated amino acids, and trimethyllysine, using different parameterization methods. Pairs of modi\ufb01ed and their corresponding unmodi\ufb01ed structures were curated from the PDB for both single and multiple modi\ufb01cations. Background structural similarity was assessed in the context of secondary and tertiary structures from the global dataset. Next, the charges derived for Force\ufb01eld_PTM were tested on a macroscopic scale using unrestrained all-atom Langevin molecular dynamics simulations in AMBER for 34 (17 pairs of modi\ufb01ed/unmodi\ufb01ed) systems in implicit solvent. Assessment was performed in the context of secondary structure preservation, stability in energies, and correlations between the modi\ufb01ed and unmodi\ufb01ed structure trajectories on the aggregate. As an illustration of their utility, the parameters were used to compare the structural stability of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of OdhI. Microscopic comparisons between quantum and AMBER single point energies along key \u03c7 torsions on several PTMs were performed and corrections to improve their agreement in terms of mean squared errors and squared correlation coef\ufb01cients were parameterized. This force\ufb01eld for post-translational modi\ufb01cations in condensed-phase simulations can be applied to a number of biologically relevant and timely applications including protein structure prediction, protein and peptide design, docking, and to study the effect of PTMs on folding and dynamics.

    "abstract": "A three-dimension idealized cloud model was used to study the storm-scale differences between simulated supercells that produce tornado-like vortices and those that do not. Each simulation was initialized with a different RUC-2 sounding that was associated with tornadic and nontornadic supercells in nature. The focus is an analysis of vorticity along backwards-integrated trajectories leading up to tornadogenesis (19 simulations) and tornadogenesis failure (14 simulations), respectively. In so doing, the differences between the nontornadic and tornadic cases can be explored in relation to their associated environmental sounding. Backwards-integrated trajectories seeded in the near-surface circulation indicate that the largest differences in vertical vorticity production between the tornadic and nontornadic simulations occur in parcels that descend to the surface from aloft (i.e. descending). Thus, the results from this study support the hypothesis that descending air in the rear of the storm is crucial to tornadogenesis. In the tornadic simulations, the descending parcels experience more negative vertical vorticity production during descent and larger tilting of horizontal vorticity into positive vertical vorticity after reaching the surface, due to stronger horizontal gradients of vertical velocity. The larger vertical velocities experienced by the trajectories just prior to tornadogenesis in the tornadic simulations are associated with environmental soundings of larger CAPE, smaller CIN and larger 0-1 km storm relative environmental helicity. Furthermore, in contrast with what might be expected from previous works, trajectories entering the incipient tornadic circulations are more negatively buoyant than those entering the nontornadic circulations.",

    "abstract": "Previous cloud modeling studies have noted difficulty in producing strong, sustained deep convection in environments with convective inhibition and/or midlevel dryness when the thermal bubble technique is used to initiate convection. This difficulty is also demonstrated herein, using 113 supercell proximity soundings\u2014most of which contain capping inversions and some amount of convective inhibition. Instead, by using an updraft nudging initiation technique, substantially more supercells result and for a longer period. Additionally, the number of supercell-producing cases is maximized when updraft nudging is applied for only the first 15 min of cloud time near the top of the boundary layer instead of longer/shorter periods or when nudging is applied near the surface.",

    "abstract": "Lithiation-induced plasticity is a key factor that enables Si electrodes to maintain long cycle life in Li-ion batteries. We study the plasticity of various lithiated silicon phases based on first-principles calculations and identify the linear dependence of the equivalent yield stress on the hydrostatic pressure. Such dependence may cause the compression-tension asymmetry in an amorphous Si thin film electrode from a lithiation to delithiation cycle, and leads to subsequent ratcheting of the electrode after cyclic lithiation. We propose a yield criterion of amorphous lithiated silicon that includes the effects of the hydrostatic stress and the lithiation reaction. We further examine the microscopic mechanism of deformation in lithiated silicon under mechanical load, which is attributed to the flow-defects mediated local bond switching and cavitation. Hydrostatic compression confines the flow defects thus effectively strengthens the amorphous structure, and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic simulations of biological systems vary widely in scope from reaction modules, to single cells, to cell colonies. While the same techniques for sampling the stochastic equations governing cellular processes apply to all these systems, the setup of the simulation volume and initial state for the simulations differ significantly. Lattice Microbes is a GPU accelerated stochastic biological problem solving environment with a general interface that meets the diverse requirements of these types of biological simulations. The software includes a Python interface that allows facile customization of the simulation setup and on-the-fly modification of the simulation state with access to highly optimized, compiled algorithms for solving the stochastic equations. Here we describe the interface to Lattice Microbes and present several examples of very different simulations that were rapidly prototyped in Python. Two examples show standard stochastic biochemical problems. As an example of the true utility of the Python interface, the highly optimized method for sampling the reaction-diffusion master equation in Lattice Microbes is coupled to the COBRA toolbox, a Python package that solves a linear programming problem representing the steady-state reaction flux through the full metabolic model of the cell. This final example shows how the Python interface allows the GPU optimized code to be used to interface with other methods.",

    "abstract": "Using all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigated the early structural intermediates of the 5\u2032 domain of the 16S rRNA in Escherichia coli upon the removal of the primary binding r-proteins S4, S17, and S20 and the secondary binding r-protein S16. Removal of each r-protein corresponded to the disappearance of subdomains with correlated dynamics. Correlation-based network analysis of the MD trajectories of the naked rRNA showed that the different subdomains are connected via multiple pathways with high betweenness. These pathways cross at the internal loop of helix 17 (h17) in the five-way junction (5WJ). The structure of the internal loop is disrupted by the binding of S17 and rescued by the addition of S16, suggesting an important function of the secondary binding protein in biasing the rRNA folding landscape toward the native basin. Using structure-based Go\u0305 simulations, we investigated the folding barriers of the lower four-way junction (4WJ) with h6, which is the primary binding site of S20 and the first to be transcribed. The folding of the 4WJ is consistent with the protection patterns observed in hydroxyl radical footprinting. Results from the all-atom simulations show that the fluctuations in the 5WJ are independent of the fluctuations in the 4WJ, suggesting that the subdomains fold independently and are stabilized by primary r-proteins.",

Our previous software enabled simulation of inhomogeneous biochemical systems for small bacteria over long time scales using the MPD-RDME method on a single GPU. Simulations of larger eukaryotic systems exceed the on-board memory capacity of individual GPUs, and long time simulations of modest-sized cells such as yeast are impractical on a single GPU. We present a new multi-GPU parallel implementation of the MPD-RDME method based on a spatial decomposition approach that supports dynamic load balancing for workstations containing GPUs of varying performance and memory capacity. We take advantage of high-performance features of CUDA for peer-to-peer GPU memory transfers and evaluate the performance of our algorithms on state-of-the-art GPU devices. We present parallel efficiency and performance results for simulations using multiple GPUs as system size, particle counts, and number of reactions grow. We also demonstrate multi-GPU performance in simulations of the Min protein system in E. coli. Moreover, our multi-GPU decomposition and load balancing approach can be generalized to other lattice-based problems.",

    "abstract": "We record sequences of Raman spectra at a plasmonic junction formed by a gold AFM tip in contact with a silver surface coated with 4,4\u2032-dimercaptostilbene (DMS). A 2D correlation analysis of the recorded trajectories reveals that the observable vibrational states can be divided into subsets, by virtue of the symmetry of DMS (C2h). The first set comprises the totally symmetric vibrations of DMS (ag) that are neither correlated with each other nor with the fluctuating background, assigned to the signature of charge-transfer plasmons mediated by DMS. The second set consists of bu modes, which are correlated both with each other and with the background. Our findings are rationalized on the basis of the charge-transfer theory of Raman scattering and illustrate how current carrying plasmons modulate the vibronic coupling terms from which the intensities of the bu states are derived. In effect, this study identifies gateway molecular modes for mediating charge shuttling across a plasmonic gap.",

    "abstract": "Assembly of the bacterial ribosomal small subunit (SSU) begins with the folding of the five-way junction upon interaction with the primary binding protein S4. This complex contains the largest contiguous molecular signature, which is a conserved feature in all bacterial 16S rRNAs. In a previous study, we used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that the co-evolving signature in the N-terminus of S4 is intrinsically disordered and capable of accelerating the binding process through a fly casting mechanism. In this paper, comparisons between the all-atom MD simulations and FRET experiments identify multiple metastable conformations of the naked five-way junction without the presence of S4. Furthermore, we capture the simultaneous folding and binding of the five-way junction and r-protein S4 by use of a structure-based Go\u0305 potential implemented within the framework of the all-atom molecular dynamics CHARMM force field. Different folding pathways are observed for the refolding of the five-way junction upon partial binding of S4. Our simulations illustrate the complex nature of RNA folding in the presence of a protein binding partner and provide insight into the role of population shift and the induced fit mechanisms in the protein:RNA folding and binding process.",

    "abstract": "The catalytic events in members of the nucleotidylyl transferase superfamily are initiated by a millisecond binding of ATP in the active site. Through metadynamics simulations on a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRSs), the largest group in the superfamily, we calculate the free energy landscape of ATP selection and binding. Mutagenesis studies and fluorescence spectroscopy validated the identification of the most populated intermediate states. The rapid first binding step involves formation of encounter complexes captured through a fly casting mechanism that acts upon the triphosphate moiety of ATP. In the slower nucleoside binding step, a conserved histidine in the HxxH motif orients the incoming ATP through base-stacking interactions resulting in a deep minimum in the free energy surface. Mutation of this histidine significantly decreases the binding affinity measured experimentally and computationally. The metadynamics simulations further reveal an intermediate quality control state that the synthetases and most likely other members of the superfamily use to select ATP over other nucleoside triphosphates.",

We find that both the energy barriers for diffusion and the topology of the atomic structure control the diffusion. We estimate the diffusion rate in amorphous Si anode to be comparable to the rate in crystalline Si anodes.

Three of these reactions were also simulated at high temperature to compare with experimental results. The reaction trajectories require 50-150 fs on average to transverse the region near the saddle point where bonding changes occur. Even with symmetrical reactants, the trajectories invariably involve unequal bond formation in the transition state. Nevertheless, the time gap between formation of the two new bonds is shorter than a C-C vibrational period. At 298 K, most Diels-Alder reactions are concerted and stereospecific, but at high temperatures (approximately 1,000 K) a small fraction of trajectories lead to diradicals. The simulations illustrate and affirm the bottleneck property of the transition state and the close connection between dynamics and the conventional analysis based on saddle point structure.",

    "abstract": "To effectively model various regions with different resolutions, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is commonly used in cosmology simulations. There are two well-known numerical approaches towards the implementation of AMRbased cosmology simulations: block-based AMR and cell-based AMR. While many studies have been conducted to improve performance and scalability of block-structured AMR applications, little work has been done for cell-based simulations. In this study, we present a parallel IO design for cell-based AMR cosmology applications, in particular, the ART(Adaptive Refinement Tree) code. First, we design a new data format that incorporates a space filling curve to map between spatial and on-disk locations. This indexing not only enables concurrent IO accesses from multiple application processes, but also allows users to extract local regions without significant additional memory, CPU or disk space overheads. Second, we develop a flexible N-M mapping mechanism to harvest the benefits of N-N and N-1 mappings where N is number of application processes and M is a user-tunable parameter for number of files. It not only overcomes the limited bandwidth issue of an N-1 mapping by allowing the creation of multiple files, but also enables users to efficiently restart the application at a variety of computing scales. Third, we develop a user-level library to transparently and automatically aggregate small IO accesses per process to accelerate IO performance. We evaluate this new parallel IO design by means of real cosmology simulations on production HPC system at TACC. Our preliminary results indicate that it can not only provide the functionality required by scientists (e.g., effective extraction of local regions and flexible process-tofile mapping), but also significantly improve IO performance.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary Galactic star formation occurs predominantly within gravitationally unstable, cold, dense molecular gas within supersonic, turbulent, magnetized giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Significantly, because the chemical evolution time-scale and the turbulent eddy-turnover time-scale are comparable at typical GMC conditions, molecules evolve via inherently non-equilibrium chemistry which is strongly coupled to the dynamical evolution of the cloud. Current numerical simulation techniques, which include at most three decades in length-scale, can just begin to bridge the divide between the global dynamical time of supersonic turbulent GMCs, and the thermal and chemical evolution within the thin post-shock cooling layers of their background turbulence. We address this GMC astrochemical scales problem using a solution methodology, which permits both complex three-dimensional turbulent dynamics as well as accurate treatment of non-equilibrium post-shock thermodynamics and chemistry. We present the current methodology in the context of the larger scope of physical processes important in understanding the chemical evolution of GMCs, including gas-phase chemistry, dust grains and surface chemistry, and turbulent heating. We present results of a new Lagrangian verification test for supersonic turbulence. We characterize the evolution of these species according to the dimensionless local post-shock Damk\u00f6hler number, which quantifies the ratio of the dynamical time in the post-shock cooling flow to the chemical reaction time of a given species. Lastly, we discuss implications of this work to the selection of GMC molecular tracers, and the zeroing of chemical clocks of GMC cores.",

    "abstract": "\u2014The increasing volume of data in large networks to be analyzed imposes new challenges to an intrusion detection system. Since data in computer networks is growing rapidly, the analysis of these large amounts of data to discover anomaly fragments has to be done within a reasonable amount of time. Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very ef\ufb01cient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware. The experimental results on a real intrusion data set demonstrate that the proposed intrusion detection system scales very well with increasing data set sizes. Moreover, it achieves close to the linear speedup by improving the intrusion detection and false alarm rates.",

    "abstract": "To support the continuing proliferation of wireless devices that operate near/on/in the human body in the UHF band (0.3-3 GHz), antenna properties (input impedance, radiation patterns, etc.) must be characterized in the presence of human models. In recent years, a significant number of different anatomically accurate high-fidelity human models have been developed for these problems (Massey et al., 34th Annu. Conf. Bioelectromagnetics Society, 2012). With a few exceptions, almost all human models developed to date are based on voxels because the underlying data sets are 2-D medical images, e.g., CT, MRI, and cross-sectional images, and because it is extremely challenging to smooth these models while maintaining their accuracy. Given the difficulty of the problem, it should be expected that voxel-based models will continue to dominate the available human models in the future. As a result, computational methods that are based on regular meshes, such as the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and conjugate gradient FFT (CG-FFT) methods, have clear advantages for analyzing scattering from human models; in fact, these methods remain the two most popular approaches in bioelectromagnetics. When antennas must be modeled, however, the classical FDTD and CG-FFT methods constrain the antenna to conform to a regular mesh to avoid significant staircasing errors. Recently, a massively parallel and preconditioned version of the adaptive integral method (AIM) has been used to analyze antennas near human models (F. Wei and A. E. Y\u0131lmaz, Int. Conf. on Electromag. in Advanced Applicat., 869-872, 2012). The AIM approach allows irregular meshes to be used when discretizing integral equations because it introduces an auxiliary regular grid to accelerate the method of moments solution. Thus, arbitrarily shaped, located, and oriented antennas can be modeled accurately by using triangular surface and tetrahedral volume meshes when AIM is used. Discretizing voxel-based hu- an models with tetrahedral volume meshes, however, is inefficient. It requires splitting each voxel into five or more tetrahedra and assigning the voxel's material properties to these tetrahedra; this increases the number of elements/unknowns without adding any information on material properties and boundary locations. In this article, the AIM procedure is modified to use mixed basis functions; specifically, voxel-based volume basis functions (rooftops) are used in the human model and triangle-based surface and tetrahedron-based volume basis functions are used in the antenna region. While a single auxiliary grid is used to enclose both the human and antennas models, the remaining AIM parameters (number of auxiliary grid points and the near-zone correction size assigned to the basis functions) are optimized separately for the different types of basis functions. The mixed basis functions are observed to reduce the iterative solution time by a factor of ~5-10.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of antennas operating near the human body in the UHF band (0.3-3 GHz) is a computationally challenging task because (i) the problem exhibits mixed-frequency characteristics, i.e., the field variations are dictated not just by geometrical features but by wavelengths/skin depths as well, (ii) complex antenna structures including thin good conductors must be modeled accurately, and (iii) modeling the inhomogeneous human body requires a large number of degrees of freedom. A promising method for this analysis is the adaptive integral method (AIM)-accelerated iterative method-of-moments solution of the frequency-domain surface-volume electric-field integral equation (SV-EFIE). Unfortunately, the formulation results in a poorly conditioned impedance matrix that causes the iterative solution to converge slowly and increases the computational costs of the method. Recently, a localized preconditioning technique was presented for improving the convergence (F. Wei and A. E. Yilmaz, Proc. of ICEAA, 869-872, Sep. 2012). The proposed block-diagonal preconditioner consisted of two blocks: The smaller block contained the inverse of the square matrix corresponding to the surface-to-surface portion of the impedance matrix; the larger block contained the inverse of the diagonal entries of the volume-to-volume portion. The preconditioned method was used to analyze radiation from a half-wave dipole in the presence of a human body model with ~ 107 degrees of freedom. The results showed significantly reduced number of iterations that remained constant as the resolution of the body model was increased. While it is effective if the antennas can be modeled with few degrees of freedom, this relatively simple preconditioning technique quickly becomes unfeasible for complex antennas, because it requires the inversion of a dense matrix. In this article, a nested preconditioning technique is proposed by building on the truncated multigrid (tMG) pre- onditioner proposed in (F. Wei and A. E. Y\u0131lmaz, Proc. URNC/URSI Rad. Sci. Meet., July 2012) and the aforementioned localized preconditioner. The method is implemented using a flexible inner-outer Krylov subspace solver (Y. Saad, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 14, 461-469, 1993). The outer iterative solver approximates the impedance-matrix vector product using AIM; it is implicitly preconditioned by the inner iterative solver that approximates the impedance-matrix vector product using an inaccurate but cheap tMG algorithm (based on coarsening the AIM grid). The inner iterative solver itself is explicitly preconditioned by using a block-diagonal matrix that consists of two blocks: The smaller and larger blocks contain a sparse approximate inverse (SAI) of the surface-to-surface portion and the inverse of the diagonal entries of the volumeto-volume portion of the impedance matrix, respectively. To implement SAI, the sparsity pattern of the approximate inverse is set to that of the AIM near-zone matrix. These choices allow both the explicit and implicit preconditioners to be parallelized using the load-balancing schemes developed for AIM. At the conference, the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed preconditioner will be demonstrated for various antennas, including patch antennas, near anatomically realistic high-resolution human body models.",

    "abstract": "Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors based on the Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture are starting to appear in HPC systems, with Stampede being a prominent example available within the XSEDE cyber-infrastructure. Porting MPI and OpenMP applications to such systems is often no more than simple recompilation, however, execution performance needs to be carefully analyzed and tuned to effectively exploit their unique capabilities. For performance measurement and analysis tools, the variety of execution modes need to be supported in a consistent and convenient manner, and especially execution configurations involving large numbers of compute nodes each with several multicore host processors and manycore coprocessors. Early experience using the open-source Scalasca toolset for runtime summarization and automatic trace analysis with the NPB BT-MZ MPI+OpenMP parallel application on Stampede is reported, along with discussion of on-going and future work.",

    "abstract": "The parallelization of the adaptive integral method proposed in Part I is used to solve 3-D scattering problems pertinent to bioelectromagnetic (BIOEM) analysis. Detailed numerical results are presented to quantify the computational complexity and parallel efficiency of the method on a petascale supercomputing cluster. Boundaries of acceptable parallelization regions of the method are identified in the N - P plane under realistic resource and efficiency constraints, where N and P denote the number of unknowns and processes, respectively. These regions are shown to be larger than those of an alternative parallelization method for benchmark BIOEM problems. The proposed method is also used to compute the power absorbed by an anatomical human body model to demonstrate its potential for solving complex BIOEM problems. The computations are performed for increasingly higher resolutions of the model and the power absorbed by the entire model and specific tissues in it are compared to safety standards. The highest resolution body model leads to an extreme problem with about 1.2 billion unknowns; the absolute parallel efficiency of the power-absorption simulation with this model is shown to be approximately 78% for matrix fill operations, 66% for memory requirement, and 30% for iterative solution on 8192 processes.",

    "abstract": "A more effective parallelization of the adaptive integral method (AIM) is proposed for solving the 3-D volume electric field integral equation. The AIM computations are distributed among processes by employing two workload decomposition strategies: 1) a novel 2-D pencil decomposition of the auxiliary regular grid is used to parallelize the anterpolation, interpolation, and 3-D FFT-accelerated propagation steps; and 2) a balanced 3-D block decomposition of the scattering volume is used to parallelize the correction step. The scalability of the proposed parallelization method is investigated theoretically. To compare it with competing methods, the concepts of resource constraints, parallel efficiency constraints, scalability limits, and acceptable parallelization regions are introduced by using N-P plots, where N and P denote the number of unknowns and processes, respectively. Using these concepts, it is shown that the proposed parallelization of AIM has better weak and strong scalability compared to the traditional ones, i.e., it enables not only larger problems to be solved but also faster solution of a given problem by increasing P.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review for the structural application, manufacturing, material properties, and modeling of a new material: steel foam. Foamed steel includes air voids in the material microstructure and as a result introduces density as a new design variable in steel material selection. By controlling density the engineering properties of steel components may be altered significantly: improvement in the weight-to-stiffness ratio is particularly pronounced, as is the available energy dissipation and thermal resistivity. Full-scale applications of steel foams in civil structures have not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, existing applications demonstrating either proof-of-concept for steel foam, or full-scale use of aluminum foams in situations with clear civil/structural analogs are highlighted. Adoption of steel foam relies on the manufacturing method, particularly its cost, and the resulting properties of the steel foam. Therefore, published methods for producing steel foam are summarized, along with measurements of steel foam structural (modulus, yield stress, etc.) and non-structural (thermal conductivity, acoustic absorption, etc.) properties. Finally, existing models for predicting foamed steel material properties are summarized to highlight the central role of material density. Taken in total the existing research demonstrates the viability of steel foams for use in civil/structural applications, while also pointing to areas where further research work is required.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of tungsten as plasma facing material in fusion environment is investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. Tungsten erosion and surface evolution is simulated during irradiation by carbon and deuterium ions. Non-cumulative pure carbon bombardment on crystal tungsten shows that substrate temperature does not affect carbon trapping rate, implantation depth, and tungsten sputtering yield. Carbon induced tungsten physical sputtering yield threshold is predicted to be around \u223c25 eV. Cumulative carbon irradiation on crystal tungsten reveals that tungsten erosion is enhanced at high substrate temperatures. Cumulative carbon induced tungsten sputtering yield matches experimental data as well as Monte Carlo results. Carbon pre-irradiated tungsten tends to trap more hydrogen and facilitates gas bubble formation. Simultaneous deuterium and carbon bombardment on crystal tungsten indicates that carbon induced tungsten sputtering yield exhibits a maximum value when carbon ratio is around 20%. Higher carbon ratio reduces both the carbon and deuterium trapping rates.",

    "abstract": "Recent models of black hole growth in a cosmological context have forwarded a paradigm in which the growth is self-regulated by feedback from the black hole itself. Here we use cosmological zoom simulations of galaxy formation down to z = 2 to show that such strong self-regulation is required in the popular spherical Bondi accretion model, but that a plausible alternative model in which black hole growth is limited by galaxy-scale torques does not require self-regulation. Instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields black holes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations by relying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the radius at which the accretion flow is fed. Feedback from the black hole may (and likely does) occur, but does not need to couple to galaxy-scale gas in order to regulate black hole growth. We show that this result is insensitive to variations in the initial black hole mass, stellar feedback, or other implementation details. The torque-limited model allows for high accretion rates at very early epochs (unlike the Bondi case), which if viable can help explain the rapid early growth of black holes, while by z ~ 2 it yields Eddington factors of ~1%-10%. This model also yields a less direct correspondence between major merger events and rapid phases of black hole growth. Instead, growth is more closely tied to cosmological disk feeding, which may help explain observational studies showing that, at least at z >~ 1, active galaxies do not preferentially show merger signatures.",

    "abstract": "6-Methylisoxanthopterin (6-MI) is a pteridine-based guanine analog that has a red-shifted absorption and high fluorescence quantum yield. Its Watson\u2013Crick base-pairing and base stacking properties are similar to guanine. The fluorescence quantum yield of 6-MI is sensitive to its nearest neighbors and base stacking, making it a very useful real-time probe of DNA structure. The fundamental photophysics underlying this fluorescence quenching by base stacking is not well understood. We have explored the excited-state electronic structure of the 6-MI in frozen 77 K LiCl glasses using Stark spectroscopy. These measurements yielded the direction and degree of charge redistribution for the S0\u2192S1 transition as manifested in the difference dipole moment, \u0394\u03bc01, and difference static polarizability, Tr\u0394. TDDFT (time-dependent density functional theory) was employed to calculate the transition energy, oscillator strength, and the dipole moments of the ground and lowest optically bright excited state of 6-MI (S0\u2192S1). The direction of \u0394\u03bc01 was assigned in the molecular frame based on the Stark data and calculations. These results suggest that the C4\u2550O and C2-NH2 groups are electron-deficient in the excited state, a very different outcome compared with guanine. This implies that Watson\u2013Crick hydrogen bonding in 6-MI may be modulated by absorption of a photon so as to strengthen base pairing, if only transiently. Solvatochromism was also obtained for the absorption and emission spectra of 6-MI in various solvents and compared with the Stark spectroscopic results using both the Lippert-Mataga and Bakhshiev models.",

    "abstract": "Surfactant protein D (SP-D), a mammalian C-type lectin, is the primary innate inhibitor of influenza A virus (IAV) in the lung. Interactions of SP-D with highly branched viral N-linked glycans on hemagglutinin (HA), an abundant IAV envelope protein and critical virulence factor, promote viral aggregation and neutralization through as yet unknown molecular mechanisms. Two truncated human SP-D forms, wild-type (WT) and double mutant D325A+R343V, representing neck and carbohydrate recognition domains are compared in this study. Whereas both WT and D325A+R343V bind to isolated glycosylated HA, WT does not inhibit IAV in neutralization assays; in contrast, D325A+R343V neutralization compares well with that of full-length native SP-D. To elucidate the mechanism for these biochemical observations, we have determined crystal structures of D325A+R343V in the presence and absence of a viral nonamannoside (Man9). On the basis of the D325A+R343V\u2013Man9 structure and other crystallographic data, models of complexes between HA and WT or D325A+R343V were produced and subjected to molecular dynamics. Simulations reveal that whereas WT and D325A+R343V both block the sialic acid receptor site of HA, the D325A+R343V complex is more stable, with stronger binding caused by additional hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with HA residues. Furthermore, the blocking mechanism of HA differs for WT and D325A+R343V because of alternate glycan binding modes. The combined results suggest a mechanism through which the mode of SP-D\u2013HA interaction could significantly influence viral aggregation and neutralization. These studies provide the first atomic-level molecular view of an innate host defense lectin inhibiting its viral glycoprotein target.",

    "abstract": "Single-layer MoS2 is proving to be a versatile material for a wide variety of electronic, optical, and chemical applications. Sulfur depletion, without destabilization of the single layer, is considered a prudent way for making the basal plane of the layer catalytically active. Based on the results of our density-functional-theory examination of vacancy structures on one side of an MoS2 layer, we show that the formation energy per sulfur vacancy is the lowest (energetically favorable) when the vacancies form a row and that the longer the row, the lower the formation energy. In addition, we find that the lowest energy barrier for the diffusion of sulfur vacancy at the row structures through the exchange of a vacancy with a nearby sulfur atom is 0.79 eV and that this barrier increases as the row elongates. We also evaluate the propensity for catalytic activity of an MoS2 layer with two types of sulfur-vacancy structures (row and patch) and find the energetics for alcohol synthesis from syngas to be more favorable for the layer with a sulfur-vacancy patch.",

    "abstract": "Linear bead-spring chain models have been widely employed to study the glass-formation of polymer melts due to their apparent resistance to homogenous crystallization. In this article, we present simulation data demonstrating that, in contrast to their bulk behavior, widely used bead-spring models are subject to rapid heterogenous nucleation and crystallization when exposed to rigid crystalline walls. We propose a modified bead-spring model, employing the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic bond, and show that it exhibits robust glass-formation in the presence of crystalline walls. This new model will enable study of supercooled polymers in the presence of rigid, atomistically structured walls, with application to study of nanoscale confinement effects on the glass transition.",

    "abstract": "Nanoscale confinement alters the dynamics of glass-forming liquids in films of order 100 nm in thickness. A common hypothesis for the origin of this long range posits that interfacial dynamics propagate into the film via cooperatively rearranging regions (CRRs). However, the precise nature of the dynamic interface remains uncertain, and its identification with CRRs has yet to be firmly established. Based on results from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a freestanding polymer film, here we show that an apparent qualitative discrepancy between computational and several experimental measures of the interfacial dynamic length scale results from a difference in definition and not from a difference in underlying behavior of experimental and simulated systems. We then show that the computational definition exhibits a direct correspondence with the expected behavior of CRRs as predicted by the Adam\u2013Gibbs theory, and we suggest that it should be possible to extract this length scale from experimental measurements.",

Randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) and universally primed polymerase chain reaction (UP-PCR) were compared to detect polymorphisms on a group of 20 isolates of F. effusum from 11 geographical locations in the southeastern USA. Two tests (run 1 and 2) of both the RAPD and UP-PCRs were conducted to assess the repeatability of the methods, and the markers scored on agarose gels. In addition, the UP-PCR markers from run 1 were scored using an automated capillary system. Both RAPDs and UP-PCR markers detected a high level of polymorphism among the scored markers (92 and 91% of RAPD markers, and 86 and 87% of manually scored UP-PCR markers in run 1 and 2 were polymorphic, respectively; 93% of UP-PCR markers were polymorphic when scored using the automated system). Unweighted paired group method of arithmetic averages (UPGMA) analysis showed both RAPDs and UP-PCR markers individually identified each isolate, producing three groupings, but only the groupings based on run 1 and 2 of the UP-PCR contained the same isolates. Bootstrap analysis based on the Dice coefficient produced phenograms from the UP-PCR data with weak to moderate node support (\u226554) for the primary branch, but no support for the RAPDs data (\u226434).

    "abstract": "Binary alloys present a promising venue for band gap engineering and tuning of other mechanical and electronic properties of materials. Here we use the density-functional theory and cluster expansion to investigate the thermodynamic stability and electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) binary alloys. We find that mixing electron-accepting or electron-donating transition metals into 2D TMD semiconductors leads to degenerate p- or n-doping, respectively, effectively rendering them metallic. We then proceed to investigate the electronic properties of semiconductor-semiconductor alloys. The exploration of the configurational space of the 2D molybdenum-tungsten disulfide (Mo1\u2011xWxS2) alloy beyond the mean field approximation yields insights into anisotropy of the electron and hole effective masses in this material. The effective hole mass in the 2D Mo1-xWxS2 is nearly isotropic and is predicted to change almost linearly with the tungsten concentration x. In contrast, the effective electron mass shows significant spatial anisotropy. The values of the band gap in 2D Mo1-xWxS2 and MoSe2(1-x)S2x are found to be configuration-dependent, exposing the limitations of the mean field approach to band gap analysis in alloys.",

    "abstract": "The coagulation cascade of blood may be initiated by flow induced platelet activation, which prompts clot formation in prosthetic cardiovascular devices and arterial disease processes. While platelet activation may be induced by biochemical agonists, shear stresses arising from pathological flow patterns enhance the propensity of platelets to activate and initiate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, leading to thrombosis. Upon activation platelets undergo complex biochemical and morphological changes: organelles are centralized, membrane glycoproteins undergo conformational changes, and adhesive pseudopods are extended. Activated platelets polymerize fibrinogen into a fibrin network that enmeshes red blood cells. Activated platelets also cross-talk and aggregate to form thrombi. Current numerical simulations to model this complex process mostly treat blood as a continuum and solve the Navier-Stokes equations governing blood flow, coupled with diffusion-convection-reaction equations. It requires various complex constitutive relations or simplifying assumptions, and is limited to \u03bcm level scales. However, molecular mechanisms governing platelet shape change upon activation and their effect on rheological properties can be in the nm level scales. To address this challenge, a multiscale approach which departs from continuum approaches, may offer an effective means to bridge the gap between macroscopic flow and cellular scales. Coarse Grained Molecular dynamics (CGMD) and discrete/dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) methods have been employed in recent years to simulate complex processes at the molecular scales, and various viscous fluids at low-to-high Reynolds numbers at mesoscopic scales. Such particle methods possess important properties at the mesoscopic scale: complex fluids with heterogeneous particles can be modeled, allowing the simulation of processes which are otherwise very difficult to solve by continuum approaches. It is becoming a powerful tool for simulating complex blood flow, red blood cells interactions, and platelet-mediated thrombosis involving platelet activation, aggregation, and adhesion.",

    "abstract": "Ultrafast deep-ultraviolet through near infrared (210-950 nm) transient absorption spectroscopy complemented by ab initio multiconfigurational calculations offers a global description of the photochemical reaction pathways of bromoform following 255 nm excitation in methylcyclohexane and acetonitrile solutions. Photoexcitation of CHBr3 leads to the groundstate iso-CHBr3 product in a large quantum yield (~35%), formed through two different mechanisms: concerted excited-state isomerization and cage-induced isomerization through the recombination of the nascent radical pair. These two processes take place on different time scales of tens femtoseconds and several picoseconds, respectively. The novel ultrafast direct isomerization pathway proposed herein is consistent with the occurrence of a conical intersection between the first excited singlet state of CHBr3 and the ground electronic state of iso-CHBr3. Complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations characterize this singularity in the vicinity of a second order saddle point on the ground state which connects the two isomer forms. For cage-induced isomerization, both the formation of the nascent radical pair and its subsequent collapse into ground-state iso-CHBr3 are directly monitored through the deepultraviolet absorption signatures of the radical species. In both mechanisms, the optically active (i.e. those with largest Franck Condon factors) C\u2212Br\u2212Br bending and Br\u2212Br stretching modes of ground-state iso CHBr3 have the largest projection on the reaction coordinate, enabling us to trace the structural changes accompanying vibrational relaxation of the non-equilibrated isomers through transient absorption dynamics. The iso-CHBr3 photoproduct is stable in methylcyclohexane, but undergoes either facile thermal isomerization to the parent CHBr3 structure through a cyclic transition state stabilized by the polar acetonitrile medium (~300-ps lifetime), and hydrolysis in the presence of water.",

    "abstract": "8-Vinyladenosine (8VA) is an adenine analog that effectively base pairs with thymine in duplex DNA. With a red-shifted absorption band centered around 290 nm excited 8VA emits Stokes-shifted fluorescence centered at 370 nm. The fluorescence quantum yield of 8VA* is sensitive to base stacking, making it an effective reporter of DNA structure and dynamics. We have performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies on 8VA in aprotic organic solvents to explore the mechanism of fluorescence quenching. Excited state oxidation and reduction potentials were calculated from the experimentally determined ground state one electron redox potentials. The Rehm\u2013Weller equation was used to obtain the free energies of electron transfer for native nucleobase monophosphate oxidation and reduction paired with 8VA*. The magnitude and sign of the free energies have been used to assess whether electron transfer is thermodynamically plausible. The results suggest that electron transfer to or from 8VA* may not be the dominant mechanism of quenching for AMP, CMP, and perhaps GMP. In contrast, TMP may be an effective electron acceptor. Taken together, the results suggest that 8VA* quenching by nucleobase monophosphates in aqueous solution proceeds through a different mechanism than ET.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of stratospheric ozone depletion on Antarctic climate, paying particular attention to the question of whether eddy parameterizations in the ocean fundamentally alter the results. This is accomplished by contrasting two versions of the Community Climate System Model (version 3.5), one at 0.1 deg ocean and sea ice resolution and the other at 1 deg with parameterized ocean eddies. At both resolutions, pairs of integrations are performed: one with high (1960) and one with low (2000) ozone levels. We find that the effect of ozone depletion is to warm the surface and the ocean to a depth of 1000m and to significantly reduce the sea ice extent. While the ocean warming is somewhat weaker when the eddies are resolved, the total loss of sea ice area is roughly the same in the fine and coarse resolution cases.",

    "abstract": "Cosmology simulations are highly communicationintensive, thus it is critical to exploit topology-aware task mapping techniques for performance optimization. To exploit the architectural properties of multiprocessor clusters (the performance gap between inter-node and intra-node communication as well as the gap between inter-socket and intra-socket communication), we design and develop a hierarchical task mapping scheme for cell-based AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement) cosmology simulations, in particular, the ART application. Our scheme consists of two parts: (1) an inter-node mapping to map application processes onto nodes with the objective of minimizing network traffic among nodes and (2) an intra-node mapping within each node to minimize the maximum size of messages transmitted between CPU sockets. Experiments on production supercomputers with 3D torus and fat-tree topologies show that our scheme can significantly reduce application communication cost by up to 50%. More importantly, our scheme is generic and can be extended to many other applications.",

In particular, clustering of large scale data has received considerable attention in the last few years and many application areas such as bioinformatics and social networking are in urgent need of scalable approaches. The new techniques need to make use of parallel computing concepts in order to be able to scale with increasing data set sizes. In this paper, we propose a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering (MRCPSO) algorithm that is based on MapReduce. The experimental results reveal that MR-CPSO scales very well with increasing data set sizes and achieves a very close to the linear speedup while maintaining the clustering quality. The results also demonstrate that the proposed MR-CPSO algorithm can efficiently process large data sets on commodity hardware.",

    "abstract": "Strand slippage is a structural mechanism by which insertion\u2013deletion (indel) mutations are introduced during replication by polymerases. Three-dimensional atomic-resolution structural pathways are still not known for the decades-old template slippage description. The dynamic nature of the process and the higher energy intermediates involved increase the difficulty of studying these processes experimentally. In the present study, restrained and unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations, carried out using multiple nucleic acid force fields, are used to demonstrate that partial base-flipping can be sufficient for strand slippage at DNA duplex termini. Such strand slippage can occur in either strand, i.e. near either the 3\u2032 or the 5\u2032 terminus of a DNA strand, which suggests that similar structural flipping mechanisms can cause both primer and template slippage. In the repetitive mutation hot-spot sequence studied, non-canonical base-pairing with exposed DNA groove atoms of a neighboring G:C base-pair stabilizes a partially flipped state of the cytosine. For its base-pair partner guanine, a similar partially flipped metastable intermediate was not detected, and the propensity for sustained slippage was also found to be lower. This illustrates that a relatively small metastable DNA structural distortion in polymerase active sites could allow single base insertion or deletion mutations to occur, and stringent DNA groove molecular recognition may be required to maintain intrinsic DNA polymerase fidelity. The implications of a close relationship between base-pair dissociation, base unstacking, and strand slippage are discussed in the context of sequence dependence of indel mutations.",

    "abstract": "Certain scientific use cases possess complex requirements to have Grid jobs executed in collections where the jobs' request contains only some variation in different parts. These scenarios can easily be tackled by a single job request which abstract this variation and can represent the same collection. The Open Grid Forum (OGF) standards community modeled this requirement through the Job Submission and Description Language (JSDL) Parameter Sweep specification, which takes a modular approach to handle different variations of parameter sweeps (e.g. document and file sweep). In this paper we present the UNICORE server environment implementing this specification build upon its existing JSDL implementation. We also demonstrate the application of UNICORE's parameter sweep extension for optimizing job executions, which are submitted as a sub-activity of a Taverna based scientific workflow. Further we validate our approach by analyzing performance of the workflow with and without using the parameter sweep extension.",

    "abstract": "Idealized simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) were performed to examine the role of capping inversions on the near-surface thermodynamic structure of outflow from simulated supercells. Two simulations were performed: one with the traditional noncapped Weisman and Klemp (WK) analytic sounding and the second with a WK sounding modified to contain a capping inversion. Both sounding environments favor splitting storms and a right-moving supercell by 90 min into the simulation. These two supercell simulations evolve in a qualitatively similar fashion, with both storms exhibiting large, quasi-steady updrafts, hook-shaped appendages in the precipitation mixing ratio field, and prominent localized downdrafts. Results show that the supercell simulated in the capped environment has a surface cold pool with larger values of pseudoequivalent potential temperature (\u03b8ep) than the cold pool of the supercell produced in the noncapped simulation. Parcels in the surface cold pool of the supercell produced in the capped sounding simulation have a lower origin height than those in the surface cold pool of the supercell produced in the noncapped simulation for all times. Although \u03b8ep values in the surface cold pool are primarily associated with the origin height of downdraft parcels and the environmental \u03b8ep at that level, it is shown that nonconservation of \u03b8ep primarily associated with hydrometeor melting can decrease \u03b8ep values of downdraft parcels as they descend by several degrees.",

However, the predictive power ofG0W0 is limited by its sensitivity to the density functional theory (DFT) starting point. We introduce a nonempirical scheme, which allows us to find a reliable DFT starting point for G0W0 calculations. This is achieved by adapting the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange in a hybrid DFT functional. The G0W0 spectra resulting from this starting point reliably predict experimental photoelectron spectra for a test set of 13 typical organic semiconductor molecules.",

    "abstract": "ClC transport proteins show a distinct \u201cbroken-helix\u201d architecture, in which certain \u03b1-helices are oriented with their N-terminal ends pointed toward the binding sites where the chloride ions are held extensively by the backbone amide nitrogen atoms from the helices. To understand the effectiveness of such binding structures, we carried out natural bond orbital analysis and energy decomposition analysis employing truncated active-site model systems for the bound chloride ions along the translocation pore of the EcClC proteins. Our results indicated that the chloride ions are stabilized in such a binding environment by electrostatic, polarization, and charge-transfer interactions with the backbone and a few side chains. Up to 25% of the formal charges of the chloride ions were found smeared out to the surroundings primarily via charge transfer from the chloride\u2019s lone pair n(Cl) orbitals to the protein\u2019s antibonding \u03c3*(N\u2013H) or \u03c3*(O\u2013H) orbitals; those \u03c3* orbitals are localized at the polar N\u2013H and O\u2013H bonds in the chloride\u2019s first solvation shells formed by the backbone amide groups and the side chains of residues Ser107, Arg147, Glu148, and Tyr445. Polarizations by the chloride ions were dominated by the redistribution of charge densities among the \u03c0 orbitals and lone pair orbitals of the protein atoms, in particular the atoms of the backbone peptide links and of the side chains of Arg147, Glu148, and Tyr445. The substantial amounts of electron density involved in charge transfer and in polarization were consistent with the large energetic contributions by the two processes revealed by the energy decomposition analysis. The significant polarization and charge-transfer effects may have impacts on the mechanisms and dynamics of the chloride transport by the ClC proteins.",

    "abstract": "Oxidation of metals generally involves coupling between chemical reactions, mass transport, and electrostatic interaction, and oxidation kinetics is usually a multiscale problem. Existing theories mostly work for either a very thin oxide film or a thick one, leaving a length scale gap for oxidation kinetics. An electrochemistry based diffuse-interface model plus a multiscale-relay scheme are developed to study oxidation kinetics in a gas\u2013oxide\u2013metal environment. The multiscale-relay scheme allows the model to coherently cover a wide range of lengths and times and study the transition stage oxidation kinetics. The coupling between interfacial reactions and ionic transport with the moving boundary problem is solved, without using assumptions such as steady state, coupled currents, local charge neutrality, or local chemical equilibrium. For the model oxidation system, in the thick film limit perfect parabolic growth law is obtained with the rate constant in agreement with Wagner\u2019s theory. Nevertheless, the Wagner-parabolic law is violated either when the oxide film thickness is on the order of the Debye length or when the interfacial reaction is rate-limiting. In addition, computer simulations reveal two space charge related effects in different situations and their linkage to experimental observations is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The properties of lipid bilayer nanometer-scale domains could be crucial for understanding cell membranes. Fluorescent probes are often used to study bilayers, yet their effects on host lipids are not well understood. We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate perturbations in a fluid DPPC bilayer upon incorporation of three indocarbocyanine probes: DiI-C18:0, DiI-C18:2, or DiI-C12:0. We find a 10-12% decrease in chain order for DPPC in the solvation shell nearest the probe but smaller effects in subsequent shells, indicating that the probes significantly alter only their local environment. We also observe order perturbations of lipids directly across from the probe in the opposite leaflet. Additionally, the DPPC headgroup phosphorus-to-nitrogen vector of lipids nearest the probe exhibits preferential orientation pointing away from the DiI. We show that, while DiI probes perturb their local environment, they do not strongly influence the average properties of \"nanoscopic\" domains containing a few hundred lipids.",

    "abstract": "A recently developed phase-field crystal (PFC) model incorporates elasticity and plasticity in the microstructural evolution of materials naturally by representing the density field for the crystalline state by periodic functions and by using a constant density for liquid state. PFC is of great interest in nano- and micro-structural modeling of materials because it is a model with atomistic scale details but is applicable to diffusive time scales. However, determining model parameters for specific materials is one of the less developed aspects of PFC modeling. In this article, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of solid-liquid structures for Fe were performed using the modified embedded-atom method to determine the melting point, latent heat, expansion in melting, density profile, and liquid structure factor. The influence of simulation cell size on the results of MD simulations was also investigated. The melting temperature, density profile, and liquid structure factor were used as inputs to find model parameters required by the PFC model for Fe. The spatial derivative order of the PFC time-evolution equation was reduced from four to two, and the resultant system of partial differential equations was solved numerically using the finite element method. The required simulation domain and element size for the convergence of the PFC simulations were determined, and the expansion in melting, latent heat and solid-liquid surface free energy were calculated. The PFC results were compared with the results of other computational and experimental works in the literature.",

    "abstract": "A dynamically biased (d-) precursor mediated microcanonical trapping (PMMT) model of the activated dissociative chemisorption of methane on Pt(111) is applied to a wide range of dissociative sticking experiments, and, by detailed balance, to the methane product state distributions from the thermal associative desorption of adsorbed hydrogen with coadsorbed methyl radicals. Tunneling pathways were incorporated into the d-PMMT model to better replicate the translational energy distribution of the desorbing methane product from the laser induced thermal reaction of coadsorbed hydrogen and methyl radicals occurring near Ts = 395 K. Although tunneling is predicted to be inconsequential to the thermal dissociative chemisorption of CH4 on Pt(111) at the high temperatures of catalytic interest, once the temperature drops to 395 K the tunneling fraction of the reactive thermal flux reaches 15%, and as temperatures drop below 275 K the tunneling fraction exceeds 50%. The d-PMMT model parameters of {E0 = 58.9\u2009kJ/mol,\u2009s = 2,\u2009\u03b7v = 0.40} describe the apparent threshold energy for CH4/Pt(111) dissociative chemisorption, the number of surface oscillators involved in the precursor complex, and the efficacy of molecular vibrational energy to promote reaction, relative to translational energy directed along the surface normal. Molecular translations parallel to the surface and rotations are treated as spectator degrees of freedom. Transition state vibrational frequencies are derived from generalized gradient approximation-density functional theory electronic structure calculations. The d-PMMT model replicates the diverse range of experimental data available with good fidelity, including some new effusive molecular beam and ambient gas dissociative sticking measurements. Nevertheless, there are some indications that closer agreement between theory and experiments could be achieved if a surface efficacy less than one was introduced into the modeling as an additional dynamical constraint.",

    "abstract": "Computation was used to design a new catalytic route for selective oxidation using molecular oxygen as the oxidant without requiring a coreductant. Formation of \u03b73-ozone intermediates is a key feature. Key steps in the catalytic cycle are: (a) the \u03b73-ozone group adds an O atom to substrate (e.g., propene) to form substrate oxide (e.g., propylene oxide) plus a peroxo or adsorbed O2 group, (b) the peroxo or adsorbed O2 group adds an O atom to the substrate to form substrate oxide plus an oxo group, (c) an oxygen molecule adds to the oxo group to generate an \u03b72-ozone group, and (d) the \u03b72-ozone group rearranges to regenerate the \u03b73-ozone group. Our Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations reveal the first instances of this catalytic cycle for any material. We expect this catalytic cycle could be used to selectively oxidize a variety of substrates. As a commercially important example, we focus on applications to direct propene epoxidation. Existing commercial manufacture of propylene oxide uses propene oxidation with one or more co-reactants and produces co-products/by-products. Direct propene epoxidation (i.e., without co-reactants) is a potentially greener process with economic and environmental benefits due to eliminating or reducing co-product/by-product formation. The grand challenge is to identify catalysts that can efficiently activate an oxygen molecule and sequentially add the resulting O atoms to two propene molecules in a catalytic cycle. We use DFT to identify and study several catalysts. Our computations introduce two new classes of Zr organometallic complexes that have dinitrone and imine-nitrone based bis-bidentate ligands, respectively. For these and bis-diimine ligated Zr complexes, we study the stability of different catalyst forms as a function of oxygen chemical potential and compute complete catalytic cycles with transition states. A new homogeneous Zr catalyst is designed with a computed enthalpy energetic span (i.e., apparent activation energy for the entire catalytic cycle) of [similar]28.3 kcal mol\u22121\u2014the lowest reported for any direct propene epoxidation catalyst to date. We propose an electrochemical cell process for assembling these catalysts and a preliminary chemical process flow diagram for direct propene epoxidation.",

Adsorption isotherms and diffusion rates of CO2, CH4, N2 and H2 in several MOFs were computed using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations, respectively. Gas permeability and selectivity of pure MOF membranes and MOF-filled MMMs were then evaluated using theoretical permeation models. The accuracy of our molecular simulations was validated by comparing theoretical predictions for gas permeability and selectivity of MOF-filled MMMs with the available experimental data. We then used the same modeling approach to predict the performance of new MOF-filled MMMs in CO2/CH4, CO2/N2 and H2/CO2 separations. Promising MOF/polymer combinations which offer high selectivity and permeability relative to pure polymer membranes were identified. Our results showed that including electrostatic interactions between adsorbate molecules and MOF atoms is crucial for modeling pure MOF membranes but has less significance for modeling MOF-filled MMMs whenever the MOF volume fraction, \u03d5 \u2264 0.30. This result suggests that preliminary screening studies of MOF-filled MMMs can be performed without assigning partial charges to MOF atoms.",

These properties make DDEC NACs suitable for constructing force-fields used in atomistic simulations. We also describe existing techniques for computing effective bond orders (EBOs) and the need to develop an improved method for computing EBOs in periodic materials.

    "abstract": "We have conducted investigations of the energy transfer dynamics of atomic oxygen and argon scattering from hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon surfaces. In light of these results, we appraise the applicability and value of a kinematic scattering model, which views a gas-surface interaction as a gas-phase-like collision between an incident atom or molecule and a localized region of the surface with an effective mass. We have applied this model to interpret the effective surface mass and energy transfer when atoms strike two different surfaces under identical bombardment conditions. To this end, we have collected new data, and we have re-examined existing data sets from both molecular-beam experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. We seek to identify trends that could lead to a robust general understanding of energy transfer processes induced by collisions of gas-phase species with liquid and semi-solid surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Prediction and control of the dynamics of complex networks is a central problem in network science. Structural and dynamical similarities of different real networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the dynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of such laws remain elusive. Here we show that the causal network representing the large-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law graph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the Internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the dynamics of complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with implications to network science and cosmology.",

    "abstract": "The Jahn-Teller (JT) active unpaired electron of single metalloporphyrin radical anions is imaged through scanning tunneling microscopy. It is demonstrated that the electron is delocalized over the porphyrin macrocycle and its topographic image is determined by vibronic motion: the orbital of the electron adiabatically follows the zero-point pseudo-rotation of skeletal deformations. Transformation of the polar graphs of the observed images allows visualization of the adiabatic vibrational density to which the electron is coupled. The vibronic potential at the conical intersection is vizualized and the half-integer angular momentum characteristic of the Berry phase is revealed in the radial function of the electron. The measurements underscore the economy of Jahn-Teller dynamics: small atomic displacements, ~10\u22121 \u00c5, determined by weak interactions, ~ 10 meV, control motion of the electron on 10 \u00c5 scale and determine molecular shape and function.",

    "abstract": "Graphene is believed to be an excellent candidate material for next-generation electronic devices. However, one needs to take into account the nontrivial effect of metal contacts in order to precisely control the charge injection and extraction processes. We have performed transport calculations for graphene junctions with wetting metal leads (metal leads that bind covalently to graphene) using nonequilibrium Green\u2019s functions and density functional theory. Quantitative information is provided on the increased resistance with respect to ideal contacts and on the statistics of current fluctuations. We find that charge transport through the studied two-terminal graphene junction with Ti contacts is pseudo-diffusive up to surprisingly high energies.",

    "abstract": "Using a realistic united-atom force field, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study homogeneous nucleation of the crystal phase at about 30% supercooling from the melts of n-pentacontahectane (C150) and a linear polyethylene (C1000), both of which are long enough to exhibit the chain folding that is characteristic of polymer crystallization. The nucleation rate was calculated and the critical nuclei were identified using a mean first-passage time analysis. The nucleation rate was found to be insensitive to the chain length in this range of molecular weight. The critical nucleus contains about 150 carbons on average and is significantly smaller than the radius of gyration of the chains, at this supercooling. A cylinder model was used to characterize the shape of the crystal nuclei and to calculate the interfacial free energies. A chain segment analysis was performed to characterize the topology of the crystal surface in terms of loops (including folds) and tails. The length distribution of loops is broad, supporting the \u201cswitchboard model\u201d for the early stage crystals formed at deep supercooling. Using the survival probability method, the critical nucleus size was determined as a function of temperature. The interfacial free energies were found to be temperature-dependent. The free energy barrier and nucleation rate as functions of temperature were also calculated and compare favorably with experiments.",

    "abstract": "Using a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallel finite element method for spontaneous rupture and seismic wave propagation simulations, we investigate features in rupture propagation, slip distribution, seismic radiation, and seafloor deformation of the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake to gain physical insights into the event. With simplified shallow dipping (10) planar fault geometry, 1D velocity structure, and a slip-weakening friction law, we primarily investigate initial stress and strength conditions that can produce rupture and seismic radiation characteristics of the event revealed by kinematic inversions, and seafloor displacements observed near the epicenter. By a large suite of numerical experiments aided by parallel computing on modern supercomputers, we find that a seamount of a dimension of 70 km by 23 km just updip of the hypocenter on the subducting plane, parameterized by higher static friction, lower pore fluid pressure, and higher initial stress than surrounding regions, may play a dominant role in the 2011 event. Its high strength stalls updip rupture for tens of seconds, and its high stress drop generates large slip. Its failure drives the rupture to propagate into the shallow portion that is likely velocity-strengthening, resulting in significant slip near the trench within a limited area. However, the preferred model suggests that the largest slip in the event occurs near the hypocenter. High-strength patches along the downdip portion of the subducting plane are most effective among several possible factors in generating high-frequency seismic radiations, suggesting the initial strength distribution there is very heterogeneous.",

    "abstract": "We assess the probable redshift (z rei \u2248 7) for full reionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM) using a prescription for the comoving star formation rate (SFR) density (\\dot{\\rho }_SFR) required to maintain photoionization against recombination. Our newly developed online reionization simulator allows users to assess the required SFR and ionization histories, using a variety of assumptions for galactic and stellar populations, IGM clumping factor and temperature, and Lyman continuum (LyC) escape fraction. The decline in high-redshift galaxy candidates and Ly\u03b1 emitters at z = 6-8 suggests a rising neutral fraction, with reionization at z >~ 7 increasingly difficult owing to increased recombination rates and constraints from the ionizing background and LyC mean free path. The required rate is \\dot{\\rho }_SFR \\approx (0.018 \\, M_{\\odot } \\,yr^{-1}\\, Mpc^{-3})[(1+z)/8]^3 (C_{H}/3)(0.2/f_esc) T_4^{-0.845} scaled to fiducial values of clumping factor C H = 3, escape fraction f esc = 0.2, electron temperature Te = 104 K, and low-metallicity initial mass functions (IMFs) and stellar atmospheres. Our hydrodynamical + N-body simulations find a mean clumping factor C H \u2248 (2.9)[(1 + z)/6]-1.1 in the photoionized, photoheated filaments at z = 5-9. The critical SFR could be reduced by increasing the minimum stellar mass, invoking a top-heavy IMF, or systematically increasing f esc at high z. The cosmic microwave background optical depth, \u03c4 e = 0.088 \u00b1 0.015, could be explained by full reionization, producing \u03c4 e = 0.050 back to z rei \u2248 7, augmented by \u0394\u03c4 e \u2248 0.01-0.04 in a partially ionized IGM at z > 7. In this scenario, the strongest 21 cm signal should occur at redshifted frequencies 124-167 MHz owing to IGM heating over an interval \u0394z \u2248 3 in the range z \u2248 7.5-10.5.",

    "abstract": "Large-eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow at Re\u03c4 = 395 are performed using explicit filtering. Two different subfilter-scale models, the dynamic Smagorinsky mixed model and the dynamic global-coefficient mixed model, are formulated in accordance with the explicitly filtered governing equations. The use of explicit filtering separates the filtering operation from discretization, thereby producing a grid-independent solution. In explicit-filter large-eddy simulations, both the dynamic Smagorinsky mixed and the dynamic global-coefficient mixed subfilter-scale models are found to produce solutions close to the non-filtered direct numerical simulation data when explicit-filter widths in the streamwise and spanwise directions and at the center of the channel in the wall normal direction are about four times the grid spacings for direct numerical simulation. Solutions obtained using explicitfilter large-eddy simulation are compared with solutions obtained using implicit-filter large-eddy simulation in a range of filter and grid resolution. Explicit-filter large-eddy simulations performed on gradually refined grids with a fixed set of explicit-filter widths are found to produce grid-converged solutions for both models. Similarly in implicit-filter large-eddy simulation, predictive capabilities of subfilter-scale models in explicit-filter large-eddy simulation are found to be interfered with truncation errors when the ratio of the explicit-filter width to the grid spacing is small",

Prior work used scaling models to detect anomalous behavior at large scales without being trained on correct behavior at that scale. However, that work cannot localize bugs automatically.

    "abstract": "A highly accurate aniostropic intermolecular potential for diatomic hydrogen has been developed that is transferable for molecular modeling in heterogeneous systems. The potential surface is designed to be efficacious in modeling mixed sorbates in metal-organic materials that include sorption interactions with charged interfaces and open metal sites. The potential parameters are compatible for mixed simulations but still maintain high accuracy while deriving dispersion parameters from a proven polarizability model. The potential includes essential physical interactions including: short-range repulsions, dispersion, and permanent and induced electrostatics. Many-body polarization is introduced via a point-atomic polarizability model that is also extended to account for many-body van der Waals interactions in a consistent fashion. Permanent electrostatics are incorporated using point partial charges on atomic sites. However, contrary to expectation, the best potentials are obtained by permitting the charges to take on values that do not reproduce the first non-vanishing moment of the electrostatic potential surface, i.e., the quadrupole moment. Potential parameters are fit to match ab initio energies for a representative range of dimer geometries. The resulting potential is shown to be highly effective by comparing to electronic structure calculations for a thermal distribution of trimer geometries, and by reproducing experimental bulk pressure-density isotherms. The surface is shown to be superior to other similarly portable potential choices even in tests on homogeneous systems without strong polarizing fields. The present streamlined approach to developing such potentials allows for a simple adaptation to other molecules amenable to investigation by high-level electronic structure methods.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the influence of velocity shear and a radial density profile on the spatial development of the current-driven (CD) kink instability along helically magnetized relativistic jets via three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In this study, we use a nonperiodic computational box, the jet flow is initially established across the computational grid, and a precessional perturbation at the inlet triggers growth of the kink instability. If the velocity shear radius is located inside the characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field, a static nonpropagating CD kink is excited as the perturbation propagates down the jet. Temporal growth disrupts the initial flow across the computational grid not too far from the inlet. On the other hand, if the velocity shear radius is outside the characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field, the kink is advected with the flow and grows spatially down the jet. In this case, flow is maintained to much larger distances from the inlet. The effect of different radial density profiles is more subtle.When the density increases with radius, the kink appears to saturate by the end of the simulation without apparent disruption of the helical twist. This behavior suggests that relativistic jets consisting of a tenuous spine surrounded by a denser medium with a velocity shear radius outside the radius of the maximum toroidal magnetic field have a relatively stable configuration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines a future climate change scenario over California in a 10-km coupled regional downscaling system of the Regional SpectralModel for the atmosphere and the Regional OceanModeling System for the ocean forced by the global Community Climate System Model version 3.0 (CCSM3). In summer, the coupled and uncoupled downscaled experiments capture the warming trend of surface air temperature, consistent with the driving CCSM3 forcing. However, the surface warming change along the California coast is weaker in the coupled downscaled experiment than it is in the uncoupled downscaling. Atmospheric cooling due to upwelling along the coast commonly appears in both the present and future climates, but the effect of upwelling is not fully compensated for by the projected large-scale warming in the coupled downscaling experiment. The projected change of extreme warmevents is quite different between the coupled and uncoupled downscaling experiments, with the former projecting a more moderate change. The projected future change in precipitation is not significantly different between coupled and uncoupled downscaling. Both the coupled and uncoupled downscaling integrations predict increased onshore sea breeze change in summer daytime and reduced offshore land breeze change in summer nighttime along the coast from the Bay area to Point Conception. Compared to the simulation of present climate, the coupled and uncoupled downscaling experiments predict 17.5 % and 27.5 % fewer Catalina eddy hours in future climate respectively.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The authors evaluate the skill of a suite of seasonal hydrological prediction experiments over 28 watersheds throughout the southeastern United States (SEUS), including Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The seasonal climate retrospective forecasts [the Florida Climate Institute\u2013Florida State University Seasonal Hindcasts at 50-km resolution (FISH50)] is initialized in June and integrated through November of each year from 1982 through 2001. Each seasonal climate forecast has six ensemble members. An earlier study showed that FISH50 represents state-of-the-art seasonal climate prediction skill for the summer and fall seasons, especially in the subtropical and higher latitudes. The retrospective prediction of streamflow is based on multiple calibrated rainfall\u2013runoff models. The hydrological models are forced with rainfall from FISH50, (quantile based) bias-corrected FISH50 rainfall (FISH50_BC), and resampled historical rainfall observations based on matching observed analogs of forecasted quartile seasonal rainfall anomalies (FISH50_Resamp). The results show that direct use of output from the climate model (FISH50) results in huge biases in predicted streamflow, which is significantly reduced with bias correction (FISH50_BC) or by FISH50_Resamp. On a discouraging note, the authors find that the deterministic skill of retrospective streamflow prediction as measured by the normalized root-mean-square error is poor compared to the climatological forecast irrespective of how FISH50 (e.g., FISH50_BC, FISH50_Resamp) is used to force the hydrological models. However, our analysis of probabilistic skill from the same suite of retrospective prediction experiments reveals that, over the majority of the 28 watersheds in the SEUS, significantly higher probabilistic skill than climatological forecast of streamflow can be harvested for the wet/dry seasonal anomalies (i.e., extreme quartiles) using FISH50_Resamp as the forcing. The authors contend that, given the nature of the relatively low climate predictability over the SEUS, high deterministic hydrological prediction skills will be elusive. Therefore, probabilistic hydrological prediction for the SEUS watersheds is very appealing, especially with the current capability of generating a comparatively huge ensemble of seasonal hydrological predictions for each watershed and for each season, which offers a robust estimate of associated forecast uncertainty.",

In the former case, density and crystal lattice parameters conformed well to previously reported experimental values. Moreover, crystallization and nuclei formation were monitored using a procedure developed herein. Analysis showed that metastable nuclei could be obtained at 250 K lasting appreciably long lifetimes of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds, which then exhibited an abrupt irreversible increase in size.

    "abstract": "Base flipping in DNA is an important process involved in genomic repair and epigenetic control of gene expression. The driving forces for these processes are not fully understood, especially in the context of the underlying dynamics of the DNA and solvent effects. We studied double-stranded DNA oligomers that have been previously characterized by imino proton exchange NMR using both additive and polarizable force fields. Our results highlight the importance of induced polarization on the base flipping process, yielding near-quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of the equilibrium between the base- paired and flipped states. Further, these simulations allow us to quantify for the first time the energetic implications of polarization on the flipping pathway. Free energy barriers to base flipping are reduced by changes in dipole moments of both the flipped bases that favor solvation of the bases in the open state and water molecules adjacent to the flipping base.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of lidar technology in remote sensing has resulted in extremely large, high resolution point clouds covering a wide variety of terrain. Constructing a grid digital elevation model (DEM) from these large data sets requires extensive computational resources and ample disk space. We propose a framework for leveraging modern computing resources including multi-core distributed systems and general purpose GPU computing to reduce computational bottlenecks and accelerate DEM construction. We employ an I/O-efficient strategy using quad trees to automatically partition the lidar point clouds into a set of independent work bundles. We then distribute these work bundles to multiple GPU-equipped hosts which independently interpolate a portion of the DEM and return partial results. Finally, we gather the partial results and assemble the final DEM I/O-efficiently. Our approach balances I/O, computation, and network communication to reduce bottlenecks. Experimental results show that our approach scales linearly with the number of compute hosts, and achieves speed-ups of 25 \u00d7 or greater using GPU computing. These results make it practical to use more complex interpolation methods such as regularized splines with tension, which provide geomorphological advantages over simpler interpolation methods such as linear interpolation, nearest neighbor interpolation, or natural neighbor interpolation.",

    "abstract": "We develop a shock- and interface-capturing numerical method that is suitable for the simulation of multicomponent flows governed by the compressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations. The numerical method is high-order accurate in smooth regions of the flow, discretely conserves the mass of each component, as well as the total momentum and energy, and is oscillation-free, i.e. it does not introduce spurious oscillations at the locations of shockwaves and/or material interfaces. The method is of Godunov-type and utilizes a fifth-order, finite-volume, weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for the spatial reconstruction and a Harten\u2013Lax\u2013van Leer contact (HLLC) approximate Riemann solver to upwind the fluxes. A third-order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge\u2013Kutta (RK) algorithm is employed to march the solution in time. The derivation is generalized to three dimensions and nonuniform Cartesian grids. A two-point, fourth-order, Gaussian quadrature rule is utilized to build the spatial averages of the reconstructed variables inside the cells, as well as at cell boundaries. The algorithm is therefore fourth-order accurate in space and third-order accurate in time in smooth regions of the flow. We corroborate the properties of our numerical method by considering several challenging one-, two- and three-dimensional test cases, the most complex of which is the asymmetric collapse of an air bubble submerged in a cylindrical water cavity that is embedded in 10% gelatin.",

    "abstract": "Article No. 46 The XDMoD auditing tool provides, for the first time, a comprehensive tool to measure both utilization and performance of high-end cyberinfrastructure (CI), with initial focus on XSEDE. Here, we demonstrate, through several case studies, its utility for providing important metrics regarding resource utilization and performance of TeraGrid/XSEDE that can be used for detailed analysis and planning as well as improving operational efficiency and performance. Measuring the utilization of high-end cyberinfrastructure such as XSEDE helps provide a detailed understanding of how a given CI resource is being utilized and can lead to improved performance of the resource in terms of job throughput or any number of desired job characteristics. In the case studies considered here, a detailed historical analysis of XSEDE usage data using XDMoD clearly demonstrates the tremendous growth in the number of users, overall usage, and scale of the simulations routinely carried out. Not surprisingly, physics, chemistry, and the engineering disciplines are shown to be heavy users of the resources. However, as the data clearly show, molecular biosciences are now a significant and growing user of XSEDE resources, accounting for more than 20 percent of all SUs consumed in 2012. XDMoD shows that the resources required by the various scientific disciplines are very different. Physics, Astronomical sciences, and Atmospheric sciences tend to solve large problems requiring many cores. Molecular biosciences applications on the other hand, require many cycles but do not employ core counts that are as large. Such distinctions are important in guiding future cyberinfrastructure design decisions. XDMoD's implementation of a novel application kernel-based auditing system to measure overall CI system performance and quality of service is shown, through several examples, to provide a useful means to automatically detect under performing hardware and software. This capability is especially critical given the complex composition of today's advanced CI. Examples include an application kernel based on a widely used quantum chemistry program that uncovered a software bug in the I/O stack of a commercial parallel file system, which was subsequently fixed by the vendor in the form of a software patch that is now part of their standard release. This error, which resulted in dramatically increased execution times as well as outright job failure, would likely have gone unnoticed for sometime and was only uncovered as a result of implementation of XDMoD's suite of application kernels.",

    "abstract": "The electric field in the growing oxide film is important to the kinetics and mechanism of metal oxidation. However, understanding of the essential characteristics of the electric field during oxidation remains insufficient. A special-case analytical model is presented that provides a unified understanding for the electric field from the viewpoints of kinetics and thermodynamics. More general cases are studied by computer simulations that show similar characteristics in the electric field. In particular, simulations indicate that in many situations, the electrostatic potential drop across the bulk oxide is limited to kT/e, which means that the total electrostatic potential drop across the oxide film, if on the order of 1 V by rough estimation, should have contributions mostly from the electrified interfaces. Finally, regarding the Gibbs\u2013Duhem relation, the commonly used isobaric assumption for the diffusing species is refuted. The results contained herein also provide a self-consistent understanding of Wagner\u2019s oxidation theory.",

In this model, the resolved fluid velocity field is obtained by solving the filtered form of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a high-order finite difference scheme. The liquid phase spray and scalar (temperature and species mass fractions) fields are both obtained by stochastic Lagrangian models. There are two-way interactions between the phases and all the Eulerian and Lagrangian fields. The liquid volume fraction is also included in the model for denser spray regions. Simulations of evaporating sprays with and without combustion indicate that the two-phase LES/FMDF results are consistent and compare well with the available experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Flow oscillations associated with hydrodynamic instabilities comprise a key element of the feedback loop during self-excited combustion driven oscillations. This work is motivated in particular by the question of how to scale thermoacoustic stability results from single nozzle or sector combustors to full scale systems. Specifically, this paper considers the response of non-axisymmetric flames to helical flow disturbances, where m denotes the helical mode number. This work closely follows prior studies of the response of axisymmetric flames to helical disturbances. In that case, helical modes induce strong flame wrinkling, but only the axisymmetric, m=0 mode, leads to fluctuations in overall flame surface area and, therefore, heat release. All other helical modes induce local area/heat release fluctuations with azimuthal phase variations that cancel each other out when integrated over all azimuthal angles. However, in the case of mean flame non-axisymmetries, the azimuthal deviations on the mean flame surface inhibit such cancellations and the asymmetric helical modes (m>0 and m",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have clearly shown the important role of swirl fluctuations in the response of the flame to flow oscillations. An important implication of this mechanism is that the axial location of the swirler plays a key role in the phase between the acoustic flow excitation source, and the resulting axial vorticity fluctuation at the flame. Similar to the previously well recognized azimuthal vorticity fluctuations, these swirl fluctuations are vortical and convect at the mean flow velocity unlike the axial flow fluctuations which are acoustic. However, there is a fundamental difference between axial and azimuthal vorticity disturbances in terms of the flow oscillations they induce on the flame. Specifically, azimuthal vorticity disturbances excite radial and axial flow disturbances, while axial vorticity oscillations only directly excite azimuthal flow fluctuations. However, the axial vorticity fluctuations do indirectly excite axial and radial velocity fluctuations, due to hydrodynamic nonlinear pressure coupling processes. This difference is significant because axisymmetric flames are disturbed only by the velocity component normal to it which stem from axial and radial components only. This implies that axisymmetric mean flames are not directly affected by these azimuthal flow fluctuations since they are tangential. Thus, it is this indirect, nonlinear mechanism that controls the strength of the flow oscillations normal to the flame that lead to heat release oscillations. This coupling process is not easily amenable to analytical calculations and, as such, we report here a computational study of the role of these different flow fluctuations on the flame response in an axisymmetric framework. Specifically, the global flame response is understood using the Flame Transfer Function (FTF). The effects of swirl, equivalence ratio and centerbody location (recessed vs. flushed) are used to understand the differences in role played by swirler generated azimuthal flow fluctuations on the Flame Transfer Function. These results indicate that the swirl fluctuations act as a secondary, but still very significant source of flame heat release disturbances, relative to azimuthal vorticity disturbances. Results indicate that these swirler generated fluctuations affect the FTF to varying degrees depending on the control parameters.",

For decades, the only evidence that CEEs actually occur has been indirect, based on the existence of systems that could not be otherwise explained. Here we propose a direct observational signature of CEEs arising from a physical model where emission from matter ejected in a CEE is controlled by a recombination front as the matter cools. The natural range of time scales and energies from this model, as well as the expected colors, light-curve shapes, ejection velocities, and event rate, match those of a recently recognized class of red transient outbursts.",

    "abstract": "Numerical calculations of merging black hole binaries indicate that asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation can kick the merged black hole at up to thousands of km s^{-1}, and a number of systems have been observed recently whose properties are consistent with an active galactic nucleus containing a supermassive black hole moving with substantial velocity with respect to its broader accretion disk. We study here the effect of an impulsive kick delivered to a black hole on the dynamical evolution of its accretion disk using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, focusing attention on the role played by the kick angle with respect to the orbital angular momentum vector of the pre-kicked disk. We find that for more vertical kicks, for which the angle between the kick and the normal vector to the disk \u03b8 ~ 45\u00b0, matter rapidly accretes toward the black hole. There is a systematic trend for higher potential luminosities for more oblique kick angles for a given black hole mass, disk mass, and kick velocity, and we find large amplitude oscillations in time in the case of a kick oriented 60\u00b0 from the vertical.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy, reliability, and skill of several objective supercell identification methods are evaluated using 113 simulations from an idealized cloud model with 1-km horizontal grid spacing. Horizontal cross sections of vorticity and radar reflectivity at both mid- and low levels were analyzed for the presence of a supercell, every 5 min of simulation time, to develop a \u201ctruth\u201d database. Supercells were identified using well-known characteristics such as hook echoes, inflow notches, bounded weak-echo regions (BWERs), and the presence of significant vertical vorticity. The three objective supercell identification techniques compared were the Pearson correlation (PC) using an analysis window centered on the midlevel storm updraft; a modified Pearson correlation (MPC), which calculates the PC at every point in the horizontal using a small 3 km \u00d7 3 km analysis window; and updraft helicity (UH). Results show that the UH method integrated from 2 to 5 km AGL, and using a threshold value of 180 m^2 s^\u22122, was equally as accurate as the MPC technique\u2014averaged from 2 to 5 km AGL and using a minimum updraft threshold of 7 m s^\u22121 with a detection threshold of 0.3\u2014in discriminating between supercells and nonsupercells for 1-km horizontal grid spacing simulations. At courser resolutions, the UH technique performed best, while the MPC technique produced the largest threat scores for higher-resolution simulations. In addition, requiring that the supercell detection thresholds last at least 20 min reduced the number of false alarms.",

    "abstract": "The Binding energy distribution analysis method (BEDAM) is employed to compute the standard binding free energies of a series of ligands to a FK506 binding protein (FKBP12) with implicit solvation. Binding free energy estimates are in reasonably good agreement with experimental affinities. The conformations of the complexes identified by the simulations are in good agreement with crystallographic data, which were not used to restrain ligand orientations. The BEDAM method is based on \u03bb-hopping Hamiltonian parallel replica exchange (HREM) molecular dynamics conformational sampling, the OPLS-AA/AGBNP2 effective potential, and multistate free energy estimators (MBAR). Achieving converged and accurate results depends on all of these elements of the calculation. Convergence of the binding free energy is tied to the level of convergence of binding energy distributions at critical intermediate states where bound and unbound states are at equilibrium, and where the rate of binding/unbinding conformational transitions is maximal. This finding mirrors similar observations in the context of order/disorder transitions as for example in protein folding. Insights concerning the physical mechanism of ligand binding and unbinding are obtained. Convergence for the largest FK506 ligand is achieved only after imposing strict conformational restraints, which however require accurate prior structural knowledge of the structure of the complex. The analytical AGBNP2 model is found to underestimate the magnitude of the hydrophobic driving force toward binding in these systems characterized by loosely packed protein\u2013ligand binding interfaces. Rescoring of the binding energies using a numerical surface area model corrects this deficiency. This study illustrates the complex interplay between energy models, exploration of conformational space, and free energy estimators needed to obtain robust estimates from binding free energy calculations.",

The modeling predictions, conducted as part of the SAMPL3 host-guest affinity blind challenge, are generally in good quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements. The correlation coefficient between computed and measured binding free energies is 70% with high statistical significance. Multiple conformational stereoisomers and protonation states of the guests have been considered. Better agreement is obtained with high statistical confidence under acidic modeling conditions. It is shown that this level of quantitative agreement could have not been reached without taking into account reorganization energy and configurational entropy effects. Extensive conformational variability of the host, the guests and their complexes is observed in the simulations, affecting binding free energy estimates and structural predictions. A conformational reservoir technique is introduced as part of the parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics BEDAM protocol to fully capture conformational variability. It is shown that these advanced computational strategies lead to converged free energy estimates for these systems, offering the prospect of utilizing host-guest binding free energy data for force field validation and development.",

    "abstract": "Energetics of protein side chain partitioning between aqueous solution and cellular membranes is of fundamental importance for correctly capturing the membrane binding and specific protein\u2013lipid interactions of peripheral membrane proteins. We recently reported a highly mobile membrane mimetic (HMMM) model that accelerates lipid dynamics by modeling the membrane interior partially as a fluid organic solvent while retaining a literal description of the lipid head groups and the beginning of the tails. While the HMMM has been successfully applied to study spontaneous insertion of a number of peripheral proteins into membranes, a quantitative characterization of the energetics of membrane\u2013protein interactions in HMMM membranes has not been performed. We report here the free energy profiles for partitioning of 10 protein side chain analogues into a HMMM membrane. In the interfacial and headgroup regions of the membrane, the side chain free energy profiles show excellent agreement with profiles previously reported for conventional membranes with full-tail lipids. In regions where the organic solvent is prevalent, the increased dipole and fluidity of the solvent generally result in a less accurate description, most notably overstabilization of aromatic and polar amino acids. As an additional measure of the ability of the HMMM model to describe membrane\u2013protein interactions, the water-to-membrane interface transfer energies were analyzed and found to be in agreement with the previously reported experimental and computational hydrophobicity scales. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of HMMM in describing protein\u2013membrane interactions as well as further development of model membranes.",

    "abstract": "Zhu et al. found in three-dimensional shearing box simulations a new form of planet-disk interaction that they attributed to a vertical buoyancy resonance in the disk. We describe an analytic linear model for this interaction. We adopt a simplified model involving azimuthal forcing that produces the resonance and permits an analytic description of its structure. We derive an analytic expression for the buoyancy torque and show that the vertical torque distribution agrees well with the results of the Athena simulations and a Fourier method for linear numerical calculations carried out with the same forcing. The buoyancy resonance differs from the classic Lindblad and corotation resonances in that the resonance lies along tilted planes. Its width depends on damping effects and is independent of the gas sound speed. The resonance does not excite propagating waves. At a given large azimuthal wavenumber ky > 1/h (for disk thickness h), the buoyancy resonance exerts a torque over a region that lies radially closer to the corotation radius than the Lindblad resonance. Because the torque is localized to the region of excitation, it is potentially subject to the effects of nonlinear saturation. In addition, the torque can be reduced by the effects of radiative heat transfer between the resonant region and its surroundings. For each azimuthal wavenumber, the resonance establishes a large scale density wave pattern in a plane within the disk.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing atomic details of membrane binding of peripheral membrane proteins by molecular dynamics (MD) has been significantly hindered by the slow dynamics of membrane reorganization associated with the phenomena. To expedite lateral diffusion of lipid molecules without sacrificing the atomic details of such interactions, we have developed a novel membrane representation, to our knowledge, termed the highly mobile membrane-mimetic (HMMM) model to study binding and insertion of various molecular species into the membrane. The HMMM model takes advantage of an organic solvent layer to represent the hydrophobic core of the membrane and short-tailed phospholipids for the headgroup region. We demonstrate that using these components, bilayer structures are formed spontaneously and rapidly, regardless of the initial position and orientation of the lipids. In the HMMM membrane, lipid molecules exhibit one to two orders of magnitude enhancement in lateral diffusion. At the same time, the membrane atomic density profile of the headgroup region produced by the HMMM model is essentially identical to those obtained for full-membrane models, indicating the faithful representation of the membrane surface by the model. We demonstrate the efficiency of the model in capturing spontaneous binding and insertion of peripheral proteins by using the membrane anchor (\u03b3-carboxyglutamic-acid-rich domain; GLA domain) of human coagulation factor VII as a test model. Achieving full insertion of the GLA domain consistently in 10 independent unbiased simulations within short simulation times clearly indicates the robustness of the HMMM model in capturing membrane association of peripheral proteins very efficiently and reproducibly. The HMMM model will provide significant improvements to the current all-atom models by accelerating lipid dynamics to examine protein-membrane interactions more efficiently.",

For small fermion masses we find two transitions at finite temperature that converge to two well-separated bulk phase transitions. The phase between the two transitions appears to be a novel phase. We identify order parameters showing that the single-site shift symmetry of staggered fermions is spontaneously broken in this phase. We investigate the eigenvalue spectrum of the Dirac operator, the static potential and the meson spectrum, which collectively establish that this novel phase is confining but chirally symmetric. The phase is bordered by first-order phase transitions, and since we find the same phase structure with Nf=8 fermions, we argue that the novel phase is most likely a strong-coupling lattice artifact, the existence of which does not imply IR conformality.",

    "abstract": "The mode number of the Dirac operator scales with an exponent related to the mass anomalous dimension gamma_m. This relation holds both in IR-conformal systems, as well as in confining systems for large enough eigenvalues. We investigate the Nf=4, 8 and 12 flavor SU(3) systems at several couplings near the chiral limit, and show that in general the scaling exponent varies with the eigenvalue, describing the dependence of gamma_m on the energy (or, equivalently, on the running coupling). This energy dependence can be explored even with fixed lattice parameters (bare coupling and mass). We find that for the 4 flavor system the mass anomalous dimension decreases as the energy increases, consistent with perturbative expectations. For the 8 flavor system the energy dependence is too weak to be observable at present. The 12 flavor system at our strongest couplings shows the anomalous dimension increasing with energy, consistent with backward flow and the presence of an infrared fixed point. At weaker couplings we determine a preliminary value for the mass anomalous dimension of the 12 flavor system at the infrared fixed point, gamma_m^*=0.27(3).",

    "abstract": "We investigate finite-temperature transitions in SU(3) lattice gauge theories with Nf=8 and 12 staggered fermions in the fundamental representation. For both of these systems, we have observed a strongly-coupled lattice phase in which the single-site shift symmetry of the staggered action is spontaneously broken. Here we report new results for finite-temperature transitions on 24^3x12 and 32^3x16 lattice volumes, contrasting the 8- and 12-flavor systems. While the Nf=12 finite-temperature transitions accumulate at the bulk transition bounding the strongly-coupled lattice phase, the Nf=8 finite-temperature transitions are able to pass through the bulk transition, and behave as expected for a QCD-like system. We discuss our current results and the work in progress to complete our investigation of the finite-temperature phase diagram.",

    "abstract": "Using large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study the Lifshitz transition of the two-dimensional Hubbard model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping (t\u2032), chemical potential, and temperature as control parameters. At t\u2032\u22640, we identify a line of Lifshitz transition points associated with a change in the Fermi surface topology at zero temperature. In the overdoped region, the Fermi surface is complete and electron-like; across the Lifshitz transition, the Fermi surface becomes hole-like and develops a pseudogap. At (or very close to) the Lifshitz transition points, a van Hove singularity in the density of states crosses the Fermi level. The van Hove singularity occurs at finite doping due to correlation effects and becomes more singular when t\u2032 becomes more negative. The resulting temperature dependence on the bare d-wave pairing susceptibility close to the Lifshitz points is significantly different from that found in the traditional van Hove scenarios. Such unambiguous numerical observation of the Lifshitz transition at t\u2032\u22640 extends our understanding of the quantum critical region in the phase diagram and shines lights on future investigations of the nature of the quantum critical point in the two-dimensional Hubbard model.",

    "abstract": "The energy density of Li-ion batteries depends critically on the specific charge capacity of the constituent electrodes. Silicene, the silicon analogue to graphene, being of atomic thickness could serve as high-capacity host of Li in Li-ion secondary batteries. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the interaction of Li with Si in model electrodes of free-standing single-layer and double-layer silicene. More specifically, we identify strong binding sites for Li, calculate the energy barriers accompanying Li diffusion, and present our findings in the context of previous theoretical work related to Li-ion storage in other structural forms of silicon: the bulk and nanowires. The binding energy of Li is 2.2 eV per Li atom and shows small variation with respect to Li content and silicene thickness (one or two layers) while the barriers for Li diffusion are relatively low, typically less than 0.6 eV. We use our theoretical findings to assess the suitability of two-dimensional silicon in the form of silicene layers for Li-ion storage.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a rigorous computational screening protocol to identify novel fragment-like inhibitors of N5-CAIR mutase (PurE), a key enzyme involved in de novo purine synthesis that represents a novel target for the design of antibacterial agents. This computational screening protocol utilizes molecular docking, graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated molecular dynamics, and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson\u2013Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) free energy estimations to investigate the binding modes and energies of fragments in the active sites of PurE. PurE is a functional octamer comprised of identical subunits. The octameric structure, with its eight active sites, provided a distinct advantage in these studies because, for a given simulation length, we were able to place eight separate fragment compounds in the active sites to increase the throughput of the MM/PBSA analysis. To validate this protocol, we have screened an in-house fragment library consisting of 352 compounds. The theoretical results were then compared with the results of two experimental fragment screens, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) binding analyses. In these validation studies, the protocol was able to effectively identify the competitive binders that had been independently identified by experimental testing, suggesting the potential utility of this method for the identification of novel fragments for future development as PurE inhibitors.",

We suggest that many of the \u2018big data\u2019 challenges facing the medical informatics community can be efficiently handled using national-scale cyberinfrastructure. Resources such as the Extreme Science and Discovery Environment, the Open Science Grid, and Internet2 provide economical and proven infrastructures for big data challenges, but these resources can be difficult to approach.

The frequency-dependent traveltime misfits between SEM synthetic Green\u2019s functions and EGFs are minimized with a preconditioned conjugate gradient method, meanwhile the 3D model gets improved iteratively utilizing 3D finite-frequency kernels. The new model shows 3 \u2013 6% shear wavespeed increasing beneath the western Sichuan Basin (SCB) (depth > 15 km) and the central Chuan-Dian Block (CDB), and 6 \u2013 12% shear wavespeed reduction in the mid-lower crust beneath the northern and the southern CDB. The inferred spatial pattern of low wavespeed zones, consistent with possible partial melt, suggests more complex and disconnected geometry than the pervasive narrow zone from the channel flow models.",

    "abstract": "Recently developed X-ray crystal structures of active state G-protein-coupled receptors have opened the way for detailed examination of the movement of the transmembrane (TM) helices and the specific residues involved in the receptor activation upon ligand binding. Previous modeling studies have indicated that the brain cannabinoid (CB1) receptor binds with a ligand at least in part through a hydrophobic tail on the ligand. This interaction is believed to be similar to the rotameric toggle switch proposed for the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR). In the present study, an active state model for the CB1 receptor, guided by the X-ray structure of the active state for \u03b22AR, was constructed with HU210 bound as a ligand. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to provide a smooth progression between inactive and active states of the receptor. This model was compared with our previously published CB1 receptor model to identify the functional residues that play key roles in triggering receptor conformational changes upon agonist binding. Movements in TM helices and functional residues are discussed. W279(5.43), contributing to an inward movement of the fifth TM helix (TM5) to the helical core, could serve as another rotameric switch for receptor activation. V282(5.46), interacting with the ligand's hydrophobic C3 alkyl chain, appears to play a key role in TM5 inward movement centered at L286(5.50) and subsequent coupling to V204(3.40). V204(3.40), closely interacting with the TM5 and TM6 hydrophobic patch residues in the middle of the receptor, particularly I290(5.54) and L352(6.44), appears to facilitate helical rearrangements, leading to the breakage of the ionic lock and the rotameric change of Y397(7.53), which are key features of the active state.",

    "abstract": "Most of the currently treated HIV-1 protease (HIV-PR) inhibitors have been prone to suffer from the mutations associated drug resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to search for potent alternatives against the drug resistance. In the current study we have tested the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) as an inhibitor in wild type (WT) as well as in three primary mutants (I50VPR, V82APR and I84VPR) of the HIV-1-PR through docking the SWCNT in the active site region, and then performed all-atom MD simulations for the complexes. The conformational dynamics of HIV-PR with a 20 ns trajectory reveals that the SWCNT can effectively bind to the HIV-1-PR active site and regulate the flap dynamics such as maintaining the flap-flap closed. To gain an insight into the binding affinity, we also performed the MM-PBSA based binding free energy calculations for the four HIV-PR/SWCNT complexes. It was observed that, although the binding between the SWCNT and the HIV-PR decreases due to the mutations, the SWCNTs bind to the HIV-PRs 3\u20135 folds stronger than the most potent HIV-1-PR inhibitor, TMC114. Remarkably, the significant interactions with binding energy higher than 1 kcal/mol focus on the flap and active regions, which favors closing flap-flap and deactivating the active residues of the HIV-PR. The flap dynamics and binding strength information for HIV-PR and SWCNTs can help design SWCNT-based HIV-1-PR inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "In the present work, the binding of inhibitor TMC114 (darunavir) to wild-type (WT), single (I50V) as well as double (I50L/A71V) mutant HIV-proteases (HIV-pr) was investigated with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as well as molecular mechanic-Poisson\u2013Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculation. For both the apo and complexed HIV-pr, many intriguing effects due to double mutant, I50L/A71V, are observed. For example, the flap\u2013flap distance and the distance from the active site to the flap residues in the apo I50L/A71V-HIV-pr are smaller than those of WT- and I50V\u2013HIV-pr, probably making the active site smaller in volume and closer movement of flaps. For the complexed HIV-pr with TMC114, the double mutant I50L/A71V shows a less curling of the flap tips and less flexibility than WT and the single mutant I50V. As for the other previous studies, the present results also show that the single mutant I50V decreases the binding affinity of I50V\u2013HIV-pr to TMC, resulting in a drug resistance; whereas the double mutant I50L/A71V increases the binding affinity, and as a result of the stronger binding, the I50L/A71V may be well adapted by the TMC114. The energy decomposition analysis suggests that the increase of the binding for the double mutant I50L/A71V\u2013HIV-pr can be mainly attributed to the increase in electrostatic energy by \u22125.52 kacl/mol and van der Waals by \u22120.42 kcal/mol, which are canceled out in part by the increase of polar solvation energy of 1.99 kcal/mol. The I50L/A71V mutant directly increases the binding affinity by approximately \u22120.88 (Ile50 to Leu50) and \u22120.90 (Ile50\u2032 to Leu50\u2032) kcal/mol, accounting 45% for the total gain of the binding affinity. Besides the direct effects from the residues Leu50 and Leu50\u2032, the residue Gly49\u2032 increases the binding affinity of I50L/A71V\u2013HIV-pr to the inhibitor by \u22120.74 kcal/mol, to which the electrostatic interaction of Leu50's backbone contributes by \u22121.23 kcal/mol. Another two residues Ile84 and Ile47\u2032 also increase the binding affinity by \u22120.22 and \u22120.29 kcal/mol, respectively, which can be mainly attributed to van der Waals terms (\u0394Tvdw = \u22120.21 and \u22120.39 kcal/mol).",

    "abstract": "A fully coupled regional ocean-atmosphere model system that consists of the regional spectral model and the regional ocean modeling system for atmosphere and ocean components, respectively, is applied to downscale the present climate (1985\u20131994) over California from a global simulation of the Community Climate System Model 3.0 (CCSM3). The horizontal resolution of the regional coupled modeling system is 10 km, while that of the CCSM3 is at a spectral truncation of T85 (approximately 1.4). The effects of the coupling along the California coast in the boreal summer and winter are highlighted. Evaluation of the sea surface temperature (SST) and 2-m air temperature climatology shows that alleviation of the warm bias along the California coast in the global model output is clear in the regional coupled model run. The 10-m wind is also improved by reducing the northwesterly winds along the coast. The higher resolution coupling effect on the temperature and specific humidity is the largest near the surface, while the significant impact on the wind magnitude appears at a height of approximately 850-hPa heights. The frequency of the Catalina Eddy and its duration are increased by more than 60 % in the coupled downscaling, which is attributed to enhanced offshore sea-breeze. Our study indicates that coupling is vital to regional climate downscaling of mesoscale phenomena over coastal areas.",

    "abstract": "Shockwave lithotripsy repeatedly focuses shockwaves on kidney stones to induce their fracture, partially through cavitation erosion. A typical side effect of the procedure is hemorrhage, which is potentially the result of the growth and collapse of bubbles inside blood vessels. To identify the mechanisms by which shock-induced collapse could lead to the onset of injury, we study an idealized problem involving a preexisting bubble in a deformable vessel. We utilize a high-order accurate, shock- and interface-capturing, finite-volume scheme and simulate the three-dimensional shock-induced collapse of an air bubble immersed in a cylindrical water column which is embedded in a gelatin/water mixture. The mixture is a soft tissue simulant, 10% gelatin by weight, and is modeled by the stiffened gas equation of state. The bubble dynamics of this model configuration are characterized by the collapse of the bubble and its subsequent jetting in the direction of the propagation of the shockwave. The vessel wall, which is defined by the material interface between the water and gelatin/water mixture, is invaginated by the collapse and distended by the impact of the jet. The present results show that the highest measured pressures and deformations occur when the volumetric confinement of the bubble is strongest, the bubble is nearest the vessel wall and/or the angle of incidence of the shockwave reduces the distance between the jet tip and the nearest vessel surface. For a particular case considered, the 40 MPa shockwave utilized in this study to collapse the bubble generated a vessel wall pressure of almost 450 MPa and produced both an invagination and distention of nearly 50% of the initial vessel radius on a O(10) ns timescale. These results are indicative of the significant potential of shock-induced collapse to contribute to the injury of blood vessels in shockwave lithotripsy.",

    "abstract": "We describe a new interface of the GPU parallelized Terachem electronic structure package and the Amber molecular dynamics package for quantum mechanical (QM) and mixed QM and molecular mechanical (MM) molecular dynamics simulations. This QM/MM interface is used for computation of the absorption spectra of the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) chromophore in vacuum, aqueous solution, and protein environments. The computed excitation energies of PYP require a very large QM region (hundreds of atoms) covalently bonded to the chromophore in order to achieve agreement with calculations that treat the entire protein quantum mechanically. We also show that 40 or more surrounding water molecules must be included in the QM region in order to obtain converged excitation energies of the solvated PYP chromophore. These results indicate that large QM regions (with hundreds of atoms) are a necessity in QM/MM calculations.",

Theory Comput.2009, 5, 2212) as implemented in the Amber software was applied to the study of several chemical processes in solution. The adQM/MM method is based on an efficient selection scheme that enables quantum-mechanical treatment of the active region of a molecular system in solution taking explicitly into account diffusion of solvent molecules between the QM and the MM regions. Specifically, adQM/MM molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to characterize (1) the free energy profiles of halide exchange SN2 reactions in water, (2) the hydration structure of the Cl\u2013 ion, and (3) the solvation structure of the zwitterionic form of glycine in water. A comparison is made with the results obtained using standard MM and QM/MM methods as well as with the available fully QM and experimental data. In all cases, it is shown that the adaptive QM/MM simulations provide a physically realistic description of the system of interest.",

    "abstract": "A new precision model is proposed for the acceleration of all-atom classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on graphics processing units (GPUs). This precision model replaces double precision arithmetic with fixed point integer arithmetic for the accumulation of force components as compared to a previously introduced model that uses mixed single/double precision arithmetic. This significantly boosts performance on modern GPU hardware without sacrificing numerical accuracy. We present an implementation for NVIDIA GPUs of both generalized Born implicit solvent simulations as well as explicit solvent simulations using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm for long-range electrostatics using this precision model. Tests demonstrate both the performance of this implementation as well as its numerical stability for constant energy and constant temperature biomolecular MD as compared to a double precision CPU implementation and double and mixed single/double precision GPU implementations.",

First released publicly in April 2010 as part of version 11 of the AMBER MD package and further improved and optimized over the last two years, this implementation supports the three most widely used statistical mechanical ensembles (NVE, NVT, and NPT), uses particle mesh Ewald (PME) for the long-range electrostatics, and runs entirely on CUDA-enabled NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs), providing results that are statistically indistinguishable from the traditional CPU version of the software and with performance that exceeds that achievable by the CPU version of AMBER software running on all conventional CPU-based clusters and supercomputers. We briefly discuss three different precision models developed specifically for this work (SPDP, SPFP, and DPDP) and highlight the technical details of the approach as it extends beyond previously reported work [G\u00f6tz et al., J.

    "abstract": "A massively parallel, direct quantum molecular dynamics method is described. The method combines a quantum trajectory (QT) representation of the nuclear wave function discretized into an ensemble of trajectories with an electronic structure (ES) description of electrons, namely using the density functional tight binding (DFTB) theory. Quantum nuclear effects are included into the dynamics of the nuclei via quantum corrections to the classical forces. To reduce computational cost and increase numerical accuracy, the quantum corrections to dynamics resulting from localization of the nuclear wave function are computed approximately and included into selected degrees of freedom representing light particles where the quantum effects are expected to be the most pronounced. A massively parallel implementation, based on the message passing interface allows for efficient simulations of ensembles of thousands of trajectories at once. The QTES-DFTB dynamics approach is employed to study the role of quantum nuclear effects on the interaction of hydrogen with a model graphene sheet, revealing that neglect of nuclear effects can lead to an overestimation of adsorption.",

We discuss the algorithms that are used to exploit the processing power of the GPUs and show the performance that can be achieved in comparison to simulations on conventional CPU clusters. The implementation supports three different precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations. We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at significantly reduced computational cost. Our implementation provides performance for GB simulations on a single desktop that is on par with, and in some cases exceeds, that of traditional supercomputers.",

Phys. 120, 5946 (2004)] in a landmark article demonstrating the efficacy of combining steered molecular dynamics and Jarzynski's nonequilibrium relation. In this study, the recently developed adaptive steered molecular dynamics (ASMD) algorithm [G. Ozer, E. Valeev, S. Quirk, and R. Hernandez, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 6, 3026 (2010)] is used to reproduce the PMF of the unraveling of decaalanine in vacuum by averaging over fewer nonequilibrium trajectories. The efficiency and accuracy of the method are demonstrated through the agreement with the earlier work by Park and Schulten, a series of convergence checks compared to alternate SMD pulling strategies, and an analytical proof. The nonequilibrium trajectories obtained through ASMD have also been used to analyze the intrapeptide hydrogen bonds along the stretching coordinate. As the decaalanine helix is stretched, the initially stabilized i \u2192 i + 4 contacts (\u03b1-helix) is replaced by i \u2192 i + 3 contacts (310-helix). No significant formation of i \u2192 i + 5 hydrogen bonds (\u03c0-helix) is observed.",

    "abstract": "Using domain-wall lattice simulations, we study pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar scattering in the maximal isospin channel for an SU(3) gauge theory with two and six fermion flavors in the fundamental representation. This calculation of the S-wave scattering length is related to the next-to-leading order corrections to WW scattering in technicolor models through the low-energy coefficients of the chiral Lagrangian. While two- and six-flavor scattering lengths are similar for a fixed ratio of the pseudoscalar mass to its decay constant, six-flavor scattering shows a somewhat less repulsive next-to-leading order interaction than its two-flavor counterpart. Estimates are made for the WW scattering parameters and the plausibility of detection is discussed.",

The second is a nanojunction formed between a 100 nm silver nanoparticle and a flat silver surface. We find that the underlying background signal in the SERS spectra collected from the former strongly resemble the SERS spectra of the nanospherefeaturing substrate, engineered to operate at the quantum limit. Our analysis of a series of SERS spectra consecutively collected from one nanocylinder suggests that the optical response of a single molecule can be extracted, with its brightest Raman active mode enhanced by a factor of 2.2 x 106.",

    "abstract": "Functional rearrangements in biomolecular assemblies result from diffusion across an underlying energy landscape. While bulk kinetic measurements rely on discrete state-like approximations to the energy landscape, single-molecule methods can project the free energy onto specific coordinates. With measures of the diffusion, one may establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape. We used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome (2.1 million atoms; 1.3 microseconds) to provide this bridge for specific conformational events associated with the process of tRNA translocation. Starting from a pre-translocation configuration, we identified sets of residues that collectively undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function. Estimates of the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates for translocation were then used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape. This analysis, in conjunction with previously reported experimental rates of translocation, provides an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation. While this analysis was performed for a particular kinetic scheme of translocation, the quantitative framework is general and may be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states.",

    "abstract": "We apply the Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model to simulate the Hurricane Ike storm surge using two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) formulations. The high resolution, unstructured grid extends over the Gulf of Mexico with open boundaries in the Straits of Florida and the Yucatan Channel. With the same wind and pressure forcing, the bottom drag coefficients for the baseline 2-D and 3-D simulations are determined by spatially varying Manning coefficients and constant bottom roughness, respectively. The baseline 2-D model simulates both the forerunner and the surge, whereas the baseline 3-D model simulates the surge, but underestimates the forerunner. Increasing the minimum Manning coefficient reduces the 2-D forerunner and the surge. Manning coefficient and bottom roughness parameterizations produce different bottom drag coefficients. Using the same bottom drag coefficient, the 2-D simulation yields a smaller surge than in three dimensions. This is investigated for scenarios of either constant or variable bottom roughness where the bottom roughness is determined through Manning coefficient transformation. These sensitivity studies indicate that storm surges, simulated either in two dimensions or three dimensions, depend critically upon the parameterizations and the parameter values used for specifying bottom stress (and similar may be said of surface stress). Given suitable calibration, 2-D and 3-D models may adequately simulate storm surge. However, it is unclear that a calibration for a given storm and location may apply generally. Hence additional experimental guidance is required on the parameterizations and the parameter values used for both the surface and bottom stresses under severe wind conditions.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in developing large scale applications is finding bugs that are latent at the small scales of testing, but manifest themselves when the application is deployed at a large scale. Here, we ascribe a dual meaning to \"large scale\"---it could mean a large number of executing processes or applications ingesting large amounts of input data (or both). Traditional statistical techniques fail to detect or diagnose such kinds of bugs because no error-free run is available at the large deployment scales for training purposes. Prior work used scaling models to detect anomalous behavior at large scales without training on correct behavior at that scale. However, that work cannot localize bugs automatically, i.e. cannot pinpoint the region of code responsible for the error. In this paper, we resolve that shortcoming by making the following three contributions: (i) we develop an automatic diagnosis technique, based on feature reconstruction; (ii) we design a heuristic to effectively prune the large feature space; and (iii) we demonstrate that our system scales well, in terms of both accuracy and overhead. We validate our design through a large-scale fault-injection study and two case-studies of real-world bugs, finding that our system can effectively localize bugs in 92.5% of the cases, dramatically easing the challenge of finding bugs in large-scale programs.",

    "abstract": "The cannabinoid (CB1) receptor is a member of the rhodopsin- like G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The human CB1 receptor, which is among the most expressed receptors in the brain, has been implicated in several disease states, including drug addiction, anxiety, depression, obesity, and chronic pain. Different classes of CB1 agonists evoke signaling pathways through the activation of specific subtypes of G proteins. The molecular basis of CB1 receptor coupling to its cognate G protein is unknown. As a first step toward understanding CB1 receptor-mediated G protein signaling, we have constructed a ternary complex structural model of the CB1 receptor and Gi heterotrimer (CB1-Gi), guided by the x-ray structure of 2-adrenergic receptor (2AR) in complex with Gs (2AR-Gs), through 824-ns duration molecular dynamics simulations in a fully hydrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer environment. We identified a group of residues at the juxtamembrane regions of the intracellular loops 2 and 3 (IC2 and IC3) of the CB1 receptor, including Ile-2183.54, Tyr- 224IC2, Asp-3386.30, Arg-3406.32, Leu-3416.33, and Thr-3446.36, as potential key contacts with the extreme C-terminal helix5 of Gi. Ala mutations of these residues at the receptor-Gi interface resulted in little G protein coupling activity, consistent with the present model of the CB1-Gi complex, which suggests tight interactions between CB1 and the extreme C-terminal helix 5 of Gi. The model also suggests that unique conformational changes in the extreme C-terminal helix 5 of G play a crucial role in the receptor-mediated G protein activation.",

    "abstract": "We present a semi-analytic, computationally inexpensive model to identify halos capable of forming a Population III star in cosmological simulations across a wide range of times and environments. This allows for a much more complete and representative set of Population III star forming halos to be constructed, which will lead to Population III star formation simulations that more accurately reflect the diversity of Population III stars, both in time and halo mass. This model shows that Population III and chemically enriched stars coexist beyond the formation of the first generation of stars in a cosmological simulation until at least z ~ 10, and likely beyond, though Population III stars form at rates that are 4-6 orders of magnitude lower than chemically enriched stars by z = 10. A catalog of more than 40,000 candidate Population III forming halos were identified, with formation times temporally ranging from z = 30 to z = 10, and ranging in mass from 2.3 \u00d7 105 M \u2299 to 1.2 \u00d7 1010 M \u2299. At early times, the environment that Population III stars form in is very similar to that of halos hosting chemically enriched star formation. At later times Population III stars are found to form in low-density regions that are not yet chemically polluted due to a lack of previous star formation in the area. Population III star forming halos become increasingly spatially isolated from one another at later times, and are generally closer to halos hosting chemically enriched star formation than to another halo hosting Population III star formation by z ~ 10.",

    "abstract": "The atom-centered density-matrix propagation method is used to illustrate how time-dependent conformational changes affect the electronic structure and derived spectroscopic properties of a prototypical finite metal cluster-bound \u03c0-conjugated organic complex, Ag 7-benzenethiol. We establish that there is considerable conformational flexibility to the model structure, even at relatively low temperatures, which influences the predicted spectroscopic properties. Namely, the computed electron densities, dipoles, and polarizabilities are all dictated by torsional motion which controls the coupling between the \u03c0-framework of the chemisorbed molecular system and the cluster.",

    "abstract": "Crystallographic structures and experimental assays of human CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) provide strong evidence for the capacity to homodimerize, potentially as a means of allosteric regulation. Even so, how this homodimer forms and its biological significance has yet to be fully characterized. By applying principles from network analysis, sequence-based approaches such as statistical coupling analysis to determine coevolutionary residues, can be used in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations to identify residues relevant to dimerization. Here, the predominant coevolution sector lies along the observed dimer interface, suggesting functional relevance. Furthermore, coevolution scoring provides a basis for determining significant nodes, termed hubs, in the network formed by residues found along the interface of the homodimer. These node residues coincide with hotspots indicating potential druggability. Drug design efforts targeting such key residues could potentially result in modulation of binding and therapeutic benefits for disease states, such as lung cancers, lymphomas and latent HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, this method may be applied to any protein\u2013protein interaction.",

We simulate with several values of the light valence- and sea-quark masses (down to \u223c ms/10) and at three lattice spacings (a \u2248 0.15, 0.12, and 0.09 fm) and extrapolate to the physical up and down quark masses and the continuum using expressions derived in heavy-light meson staggered chiral perturbation theory. We renormalize the heavy-light axial current using a mostly nonperturbative method such that only a small correction to unity must be computed in lattice perturbation theory and higher-order terms are expected to be small.

    "abstract": "Numerical modeling of three-dimensional estuarine circulation is often challenging due to complex bathymetry, small-scale flow features and strong density gradients. In this paper the skill of a specific model is assessed against a high-resolution data set, obtained in a river-dominated mesotidal estuary with autonomous underwater vehicles and a shipborne winched profiler. The measurements provide a detailed view of the salt wedge dynamics of the Columbia River Estuary under contrasting forcing conditions, and provide an excellent benchmark for numerical circulation models in general. The benchmark is used to test an unstructured grid finite element circulation model. After the model's sensitivity to grid resolution and time step is examined, a detailed skill assessment is provided for the best configuration. The simulations reproduce timing and tidal asymmetry of the salt pulses very well. Sharp density gradients, however, tend to be smoothed out affecting vertical mixing and gravitational circulation. We show that gravitational salt transport is underestimated in the model, but is partially compensated through tidal effects. The discrepancy becomes most pronounced when the stratification is strongest, i.e. under high river discharge and neap tide conditions.",

    "abstract": "Using staggered fermions and twisted boundary conditions, we calculate the K meson semileptonic decay vector form factor at zero momentum transfer. The HISQ formulation is used for the valence quarks, while the sea quarks are simulated with the asqtad action (MILC Nf = 2+1 configurations). For the chiral and continuum extrapolation we use two-loop continuum \u03c7PT, supplemented by partially quenched staggered \u03c7PT at one loop. Our result is f+Kpi(0) = 0.9667 \u00b1 0.0023 \u00b1 0.0033, where the first error is statistical and the second is the sum in quadrature of the systematic uncertainties. This result is the first Nf = 2 + 1 calculation with two lattice spacings and a controlled continuum extrapolation. It is also the most precise result to date for the vector form factor and, although the central value is larger than previous unquenched lattice calculations, it is compatible with them within errors. Combining our value for f+Kpi(0) with the latest experimental measurements of K semileptonic decays, we obtain |Vus| = 0.2238 \u00b1 0.0009 \u00b1 0.0005, where the first error is from f+Kpi(0) and the second one is experimental.

We compute fK+/fpi+ numerically in unquenched lattice QCD using gauge-field ensembles recently generated that include four flavors of dynamical quarks: up, down, strange, and charm. We analyze data at four lattice spacings a \u2248 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, and 0.15 fm with simulated pion masses down to the physical value 135 MeV. We obtain fK+/fpi+ = 1.1970(29)(57), where the errors are statistical and total systematic, respectively. This is the first physics result from our Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 ensembles, and the first calculation of fK+ /fpi+ from lattice-QCD simulations at the physical point. Our result is the most precise lattice-QCD determination of fK+ /fpi+ , with an error comparable to the current world average. When combined with experimental measurements of the leptonic branching fractions, it leads to a precise determination of |Vus|/|Vud| = 0.2304(12)(4) where the errors are theoretical and experimental, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The semileptonic decay channel B --> D\u03c4\u03bd is sensitive to the presence of a scalar current, such as that mediated by a charged-Higgs boson. Recently the BaBar experiment reported the first observation of the exclusive semileptonic decay B --> D\u03c4\u2212\u03bd, finding an approximately 2\u03c3 disagreement with the Standard-Model prediction for the ratio R(D) = BR(B --> D\u03c4\u03bd)/BR(B --> Dl\u03bd), where l = e,\u03bc. We compute this ratio of branching fractions using hadronic form factors computed in unquenched lattice QCD and obtain R(D) = 0.316(12)(7), where the errors are statistical and total systematic, respectively. This result is the first Standard-Model calculation of R(D) from ab initio full QCD. Its error is smaller than that of previous estimates, primarily due to the reduced uncertainty in the scalar form factor f0(q2). Our determination of R(D) is approximately 1\u03c3 higher than previous estimates and, thus, reduces the tension with experiment. We also compute R(D) in models with electrically charged scalar exchange, such as the type II two-Higgs doublet model. Once again, our result is consistent with, but approximately 1\u03c3 higher than, previous estimates for phenomenologically relevant values of the scalar coupling in the type II model. As a byproduct of our calculation, we also present the Standard-Model prediction for the longitudinal polarization ratio PL(D) = 0.325(4)(3).",

To carry out the search we use a Computer Vision technique called Word Spotting. A form of content based image retrieval, it avoids the still difficult task of directly recognizing the text by allowing a user to search using a query image containing handwritten text and ranking a database of images in terms of those that contain more similar looking content. In order to make this search capability available on an archive three computationally expensive pre-processing steps are required. We describe these steps, the open source framework we have developed, and how it can be used not only on the recently released 1940 Census data containing nearly 4 million high resolution scanned forms, but also on other collections of forms. With a growing demand to digitize our wealth of paper archives we see this type of automated search as a low cost scalable alternative to the costly manual transcription that would otherwise be required.",

We describe our efforts with the National Archives (NARA) to provide searchable access to the 1940 Census data and discuss the HPC resources needed to implement the suggested framework. Instead of trying to recognize the handwritten text, a still very difficult task, we use a content based image retrieval technique known as Word Spotting. Through this paradigm, the system is queried by the use of handwritten text images instead of ASCII text and ranked groups of similar looking images are presented to the user. A significant amount of computing power is needed to accomplish the pre-processing of the data so to make this search capability available on an archive. The required preprocessing steps and the open source framework developed are discussed focusing specifically on HPC considerations that are relevant when preparing to provide searchable access to sizeable collections, such as the US Census. Having processed the state of North Carolina from the 1930 Census using 98,000 SUs we estimate the processing of the entire country for 1940 could require up to 2.5 million SUs. The proposed framework can be used to provide an alternative to costly manual transcriptions for a variety of digitized paper archives.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: During elongation, multi-subunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs) cycle between phosphodiester bond formation and nucleic acid translocation. In the conformation associated with catalysis, the mobile \"trigger loop\" of the catalytic subunit closes on the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate. Closing of the trigger loop is expected to exclude water from the active site, and dehydration may contribute to catalysis and fidelity. In the absence of a NTP substrate in the active site, the trigger loop opens, which may enable translocation. Another notable structural element of the RNAP catalytic center is the \"bridge helix\" that separates the active site from downstream DNA. The bridge helix may participate in translocation by bending against the RNA/DNA hybrid to induce RNAP forward movement and to vacate the active site for the next NTP loading. The transition between catalytic and translocation conformations of RNAP is not evident from static crystallographic snapshots in which macromolecular motions may be restrained by crystal packing. RESULTS: All atom molecular dynamics simulations of Thermus thermophilus (Tt) RNAP reveal flexible hinges, located within the two helices at the base of the trigger loop, and two glycine hinges clustered near the N-terminal end of the bridge helix. As simulation progresses, these hinges adopt distinct conformations in the closed and open trigger loop structures. A number of residues (described as \"switch\" residues) trade atomic contacts (ion pairs or hydrogen bonds) in response to changes in hinge orientation. In vivo phenotypes and in vitro activities rendered by mutations in the hinge and switch residues in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) RNAP II support the importance of conformational changes predicted from simulations in catalysis and translocation. During simulation, the elongation complex with an open trigger loop spontaneously translocates forward relative to the elongation complex with a closed trigger loop. CONCLUSIONS: Switching between catalytic and translocating RNAP forms involves closing and opening of the trigger loop and long-range conformational changes in the atomic contacts of amino acid side chains, some located at a considerable distance from the trigger loop and active site. Trigger loop closing appears to support chemistry and the fidelity of RNA synthesis. Trigger loop opening and limited bridge helix bending appears to promote forward nucleic acid translocation.",

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates important cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. EGFR is frequently over expressed in a range of cancers, and is associated with disease progression and treatment. Clinical studies have shown that EGFR mutations confer tumour sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. In this study we have performed molecular dynamics simulations over several microseconds for wild-type and L858R mutant forms of EGFR in the ligand-free state. Close inspection of the conformations and interactions within the binding pocket reveals, converse to the wild-type, that the mutant EGFR prefers to bind gefitinib, a targeted anti-cancer drug, rather than ATP, offering an explanation for why gefitinib is more effective in patients with EGFR mutations than those without.",

    "abstract": "A fully coupled regional downscaling system based on the Regional Spectral Model (RSM) for atmosphere and the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) for the ocean was developed for the purpose of downscaling observed analysis or global model outputs. The two models share the same grid and resolution with efficient parallelization through the use of dual message passing interfaces. Coupled downscaling was performed using historical Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) oceanic reanalysis and NCEP/DOE (R-2) atmospheric reanalysis in order to study the impact of coupling on the regional scale atmospheric analysis. The results were subsequently compared with the uncoupled downscaling forced by the prescribed observed sea surface temperature (SST). The coupled experiment yielded the SST and ocean current with realistic small-scale oceanic features that are almost absent in the oceanic reanalysis. Upwelling over the California coast is well resolved and comparable to findings obtained from high-resolution observations. The coupling impact on the atmospheric circulation mainly modulates the near surface atmospheric variables when compared to the simulation conducted without coupling. The duration of the Catalina Eddy detected in the coupled experiment increased by about 6.5% when compared to that in the uncoupled experiment. The offshore land breeze is enhanced by about 10%, whereas the change in the onshore sea breeze is very small during the summer.",

Traditional MCRG two-lattice matching requires that the renormalization scheme be optimized for each bare lattice coupling, so that s_b is a composite of many different discrete beta functions. We propose an improved procedure that uses the Wilson flow to eliminate the need for this optimization of the RG blocking transformation. While our 12-flavor results indicate an infrared fixed point, s_b for N_f=8 is significantly different from zero until strong-coupling lattice artifacts obstruct two-lattice matching. Although both procedures produce qualitatively similar bare step-scaling functions, the new s_b obtained by combining the Wilson flow with MCRG two-lattice matching have the distinct advantage of corresponding to unique discrete beta functions.",

    "abstract": "The estimation and utilization of photometric redshift probability density functions (photo-z PDFs) have become increasingly important over the last few years and currently there exist a wide variety of algorithms to compute photo-z's, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present a novel and efficient Bayesian framework that combines the results from different photo-z techniques into a more powerful and robust estimate by maximizing the information from the photometric data. To demonstrate this, we use a supervised machine learning technique based on random forest, an unsupervised method based on self-organizing maps, and a standard template-fitting method but can be easily extended to other existing techniques. We use data from the DEEP2 survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to explore different methods for combining the predictions from these techniques. By using different performance metrics, we demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy of our final photo-z estimate over the best input technique, that the fraction of outliers is reduced, and that the identification of outliers is significantly improved when we apply a na\u00efve Bayes classifier to this combined information. Our more robust and accurate photo-z PDFs will allow even more precise cosmological constraints to be made by using current and future photometric surveys. These improvements are crucial as we move to analyse photometric data that push to or even past the limits of the available training data, which will be the case with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.",

Its crucial role in the viral life cycle has made it one of the major targets for antiretroviral drug therapy. The Non-Nucleoside RT Inhibitor (NNRTI) class of drugs binds allosterically to the enzyme, affecting many aspects of its activity. We use both coarse grained network models and atomistic molecular dynamics to explore the changes in protein dynamics induced by NNRTI binding. We identify changes in the flexibility and conformation of residue Glu396 in the RNaseH primer grip which could provide an explanation for the acceleration in RNaseH cleavage rate observed experimentally in NNRTI bound HIV-1 RT. We further suggest a plausible path for conformational and dynamic changes to be communicated from the vicinity of the NNRTI binding pocket to the RNaseH at the other end of the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines the oceanic and atmospheric variability over the Intra-American Seas (IAS) from a 32-year integration of a 15-km coupled regional climate model consisting of the Regional Spectral Model (RSM) for the atmosphere and the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) for the ocean. It is forced at the lateral boundaries by National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Department of Energy (NCEP-DOE R-2) atmospheric global reanalysis and Simplified Ocean Data Assimilation global oceanic reanalysis. This coupled downscaling integration is a free run without any heat flux correction and is referred as the Regional Ocean\u2013Atmosphere coupled downscaling of global Reanalysis over the Intra-American Seas (ROARS). The paper examines the fidelity of ROARS with respect to independent observations that are both satellite based and in situ. In order to provide a perspective on the fidelity of the ROARS simulation, we also compare it with the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), a modern global ocean\u2013atmosphere reanalysis product. Our analysis reveals that ROARS exhibits reasonable climatology and interannual variability over the IAS region, with climatological SST errors less than 1 C except along the coastlines. The anomaly correlation of the monthly SST and precipitation anomalies in ROARS are well over 0.5 over the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, Western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans. A highlight of the ROARS simulation is its resolution of the loop current and the episodic eddy events off of it. This is rather poorly simulated in the CFSR. This is also reflected in the simulated, albeit, higher variance of the sea surface height in ROARS and the lack of any variability in the sea surface height of the CFSR over the IAS. However the anomaly correlations of the monthly heat content anomalies of ROARS are comparatively lower, especially over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. This is a result of ROARS exhibiting a bias of underestimation (overestimation) of high (low) clouds. ROARS like CFSR is also able to capture the Caribbean Low Level Jet and its seasonal variability reasonably well.",

    "abstract": "We examine the nonlinear development of unstable magnetosonic waves driven by a background radiative flux\u2014the radiation-driven magneto-acoustic instability (RMI, a.k.a. the \"photon bubble\" instability). The RMI may serve as a persistent source of density, radiative flux, and magnetic field fluctuations in stably stratified, optically thick media. The conditions for instability are present in a variety of astrophysical environments and do not require the radiation pressure to dominate or the magnetic field to be strong. Here, we numerically study the saturation properties of the RMI, covering three orders of magnitude in the relative strength of radiation, magnetic field, and gas energies. Two-dimensional, time-dependent radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of local, stably stratified domains are conducted with Zeus-MP in the optically thick, highly conducting limit. Our results confirm the theoretical expectations of Blaes & Socrates in that the RMI operates even in gas-pressure-dominated environments that are weakly magnetized. The saturation amplitude is a monotonically increasing function of the ratio of radiation to gas pressure. Keeping this ratio constant, we find that the saturation amplitude peaks when the magnetic pressure is comparable to the radiation pressure. We discuss the implications of our results for the dynamics of magnetized stellar envelopes, where the RMI should act as a source of sub-photospheric perturbations.",

    "abstract": "We study the transition to runaway expansion of an initially stalled core-collapse supernova shock. The neutrino luminosity, mass accretion rate, and neutrinospheric radius are all treated as free parameters. In spherical symmetry, this transition is mediated by a global non-adiabatic instability that develops on the advection time and reaches nonlinear amplitude. Here, we perform high-resolution, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of stalled supernova shocks with realistic microphysics to analyze this transition. We find that radial instability is a sufficient condition for runaway expansion if the neutrinospheric parameters do not vary with time and if heating by the accretion luminosity is neglected. For a given unstable mode, transition to runaway occurs when fluid in the gain region reaches positive specific energy. We find approximate instability criteria that accurately describe the behavior of the system over a wide region of parameter space. The threshold neutrino luminosities are in general different than the limiting value for a steady-state solution. We hypothesize that multidimensional explosions arise from the excitation of unstable large-scale modes of the turbulent background flow, at threshold luminosities that are lower than in the laminar case.",

    "abstract": "Galaxies in clusters are more likely to be of early type and to have lower star formation rates than galaxies in the field. Recent observations and simulations suggest that cluster galaxies may be `pre-processed' by group or filament environments and that galaxies that fall into a cluster as part of a larger group can stay coherent within the cluster for up to one orbital period (`post-processing'). We investigate these ideas by means of a cosmological N-body simulation and idealized N-body plus hydrodynamics simulations of a group-cluster merger. We find that group environments can contribute significantly to galaxy pre-processing by means of enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, removal of galaxies' hot halo gas by ram pressure stripping and tidal truncation of their galaxies. Tidal distortion of the group during infall does not contribute to pre-processing. Post-processing is also shown to be effective: galaxy-galaxy collisions are enhanced during a group's pericentric passage within a cluster, the merger shock enhances the ram pressure on group and cluster galaxies and an increase in local density during the merger leads to greater galactic tidal truncation.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that the transition between magnetorotationally active and dead zones in protoplanetary disks should be prone to the excitation of vortices via Rossby wave instability (RWI). However, the only numerical evidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic field evolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parameterized by Laplacian viscosity. We aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the transition in three-dimensional resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. We model the transition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zone boundary, using the PENCIL CODE to simulate the flow. We find that vortices are readily excited in the dead side of the transition. We measure the mass accretion rate finding similar levels of Reynolds stress at the dead and active zones, at the \u03b1 \u2248 10-2 level. The vortex sits in a pressure maximum and does not migrate, surviving until the end of the simulation. A pressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the RWI. The magnetized vortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-elliptic instabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution. This suggests that either the parasitic modes are still numerically damped or that the RWI supplies vorticity faster than they can destroy it. We conclude that the resistive transition between the active and dead zones in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, if sharp enough, can indeed excite vortices via RWI. Our results lend credence to previous works that relied on the alpha-disk approximation, and caution against the use of overly reduced azimuthal coverage on modeling this transition.",

    "abstract": "Water plays a crucial part in virtually all protein\u2013ligand binding processes in and out of equilibrium. Here, we investigate the role of water in the binding kinetics of a ligand to a prototypical hydrophobic pocket by explicit-water molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and implicit diffusional approaches. The concave pocket in the unbound state exhibits wet/dry hydration oscillations whose magnitude and time scale are significantly amplified by the approaching ligand. In turn, the ligand\u2019s stochastic motion intimately couples to the slow hydration fluctuations, leading to a sixfold-enhanced friction in the vicinity of the pocket entrance. The increased friction considerably decelerates association in the otherwise barrierless system, indicating the importance of molecular-scale hydrodynamic effects in cavity\u2013ligand binding arising due to capillary fluctuations. We derive and analyze the diffusivity profile and show that the mean first passage time distribution from the MD simulation can be accurately reproduced by a standard Brownian dynamics simulation if the appropriate position-dependent friction profile is included. However, long-time decays in the water\u2013ligand (random) force autocorrelation demonstrate violation of the Markovian assumption, challenging standard diffusive approaches for rate prediction. Remarkably, the static friction profile derived from the force correlations strongly resembles the profile derived on the Markovian assumption apart from a simple shift in space, which can be rationalized by a time\u2013space retardation in the ligand\u2019s downhill dynamics toward the pocket. The observed spatiotemporal hydrodynamic coupling may be of biological importance providing the time needed for conformational receptor\u2013ligand adjustments, typical of the induced-fit paradigm.",

    "abstract": "The complex of lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1/KDM1A) with its corepressor protein CoREST is an exceptionally relevant target for epigenetic drugs. Here, we provide insight into the local and global changes of LSD1/CoREST conformational dynamics that occur upon H3 binding on the basis of a total cumulative time of one microsecond molecular dynamics simulation. The LSD1/CoREST complex functions as an allosteric nanoscale-binding clamp, which is regulated by substrate binding. In the unbound state, LSD1/CoREST reversibly visits clamp states that are more open or significantly more closed compared with the available X-ray crystal structures. The Lys triad of residues Lys355, Lys357, and Lys359 gates the entrance of the H3 pocket. H3 binding shifts the pocket breathing dynamics toward open, higher-volume states while reducing the overall flexibility of the LSD1/CoREST nanoscale clamp. We show that the H3 pocket is an allosteric site for the regulation of the rotation of the amino oxidase domain with respect to the Tower domain. The allosteric mechanism relies on the specific reduction of nanoscale domain rotation upon local H3-tail binding. Instead, clamp opening/closing motions that do not involve domain rotation only reduce in amplitude yet are dominant in the bound state. Overall, our data suggest that the H3 binding pocket is a central target site to (i) switch off LSD1 amino oxidase activity, thus H3-tail demethylation; (ii) block the competitive binding of transcription factors; and (iii) prevent chromatin anchoring to LSD1/CoREST. This study underscores the importance of receptor flexibility for future epigenetic drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "From a chemist\u2019s perspective, electron transfer in molecular wires is simply the movement of electrons from an occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to an unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). In order to create an optimal molecular wire, it is necessary to determine structures that encourage metal-metal electron transfer. Triple decker sandwich complexes of the type M1M2(C5H5)3 where M1=Fe, Ru, Os and M2=Fe, Ru, Os have been proposed as the smallest repeating subunits of molecular wires. Using density functional theory (DFT), a method previously shown to provide accurate energies, the M1-M2 distance was varied for each of the triple decker molecule subunits to determine the relationship between M1-M2 distance and the HOMO-LUMO gap. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO varied from 4.2 to 4.5 eV based on the identity of the metals and decreased as the distance between the two metals increased.",

The direct simulation Monte Carlo method enhanced with a simpli\ufb01ed description of Al vapor burning in air is used in the simulations. The results of the simulations reveal a signi\ufb01cant effect of the external gas pressure on the \ufb02ow structures and the mechanisms of the alumina and oxygen transport to the target surface. At small values of pressure, the transport of both alumina and oxygen is controlled by diffusion and the formation of alumina \ufb01lm on the surface of the laser spot is dominated by the direct sedimentation of alumina from the gas \ufb02ow. In this regime, the \ufb02ux of oxygen to the laser spot is by an order of magnitude smaller than that of alumina. At higher values of pressure, the diffusion cannot directly deliver oxygen and alumina to the surface of the laser spot, but the circulating \ufb02ow generated upstream the spot can effectively trap alumina formed in the \ufb02ame zone and deposit it to the target surface. In this regime, the likely mechanism of the alumina \ufb01lm formation within the spot is the heterogeneous oxidation and growth of the \ufb01lm from the upstream edge of the spot in the downstream direction.",

    "abstract": "The exchange of energy between low-frequency mechanical oscillations and high-frequency vibrational modes in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a process that plays an important role in a range of dynamic phenomena involving the dissipation of mechanical energy in both individual CNTs and CNT-based materials. The rates and channels through which acoustic energy deposited instantaneously in individual CNTs is dissipated are investigated in a series of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Several distinct regimes of energy dissipation, dependent on the initial stretching or bending deformations, are established. The onset of axial or bending buckling marks the transition from a regime of slow thermalization to a regime in which the energy associated with longitudinal and bending oscillations is rapidly damped. In the case of stretching vibrations, an intermediate regime is revealed in which dynamic coupling between longitudinal vibrational modes and the radial \u201csquash\u201d mode causes delayed axial buckling followed by a rapid transfer of energy to high-frequency vibrations. The results of the atomistic simulations are used in the design and parameterization of a \u201cheat bath\u201d description of thermal energy in a mesoscopic model, which is capable of simulating systems consisting of thousands of interacting CNTs. Two complementary methods for the description of mechanical energy dissipation in the mesoscopic model are developed. The relatively slow dissipation of acoustic vibrations in the absence of buckling is described by adding a damping force to the equations of motion of the dynamic elements of the mesoscopic model. The sharp increase in the energy dissipation rate at the onset of buckling is reproduced by incorporating a hysteresis loop into the strain energy that accounts for localized thermalization in the vicinity of buckling kinks. The ability of the mesoscopic model to reproduce the complex multistep processes of acoustic energy dissipation predicted by the atomistic simulations is demonstrated in mesoscopic simulations of free stretching and bending vibrations of individual CNTs.",

A moderate amount of four-spin ring exchange couplings stabilizes the ordered antiferromagnetic N\u00e9el state while a large amount renders it unstable.

    "abstract": "Myosin VI possesses multiple unique features and is the only myosin known to move toward the (\u2212)-end of actin filaments. This study used sequence and structure analyses to identify residues that are specific for myosin VI. Comparing the amino acids within myosin VI as well as between myosin VI and other myosins, we identified a series of myosin VI residues in the head region that are not only highly conserved in myosin VI, but whose amino acids are also distinct from those of other myosins. The majority of these myosin VI-specific residues have never been examined or speculated for their functional roles in myosin VI. Many of these residues locate in or adjacent to the converter domain. Among these residues, M701, P444, and F763 were revealed as unique for myosin VI. To further identify the mechanistic roles of these residues, we computationally mutated these three residues and examined their effects on conformational equilibrium using molecular dynamics simulation. We found that within a short 50-ns simulation, the conformational equilibria of mutated M701 and F763 were significantly deviated from the original states, indicating their important roles in linking the converter domain and the motor domain in the prestroke structure, potentially critical for the special rotation angle of myosin VI.",

    "abstract": "Speech is a basic means of daily communication for most people. The voice disorders are debilitating and can lead to discomfort, pain, po or work performance, social withdrawal, and even long-te rm disability. Compared to the in vivo experiment, which often proves challenging if not impossible, an advanced computational model of the fluid\u2013structure interaction (FSI) during phonation will find useful applications in diagnosis and surgery planning for voice disorders. For exampl e, the stresses and strains in the tissue calculated from the model can be used to correlate with the changes observed in epithelial morphology, tissue permeability, and inflammatory gene expression, and will thus lead to new explanations for the cause of acute phonation disorders. In addition, computational modeling of the surgically altered vocal folds may be used to predict and improve the outcome of implants (e.g., medialization laryngoplasty). To date, such an advanced model is still under development. In this work, we couple an immersed-boundary method and a finite-element method to compute the 3D vibration of a pair of vocal folds whose tissue is modeled as a hyperelastic material. With such a nonlinear material behavior, the simulation may incorporate large deformations of the tissue without the assumption for linear elasticity. In addition, the wave motions along the inferior-superior, lateral, and anterior-posterior directions are discussed by considering two vocal folds of uniform cross section.",

The FSI is achieved through a strong coupling and partitioned approach. We perform several validation cases, and the results may be used to expand the currently limited database of FSI benchmark study. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of the present method by applying it to the aerodynamics of elastic wings of insects and the flow-induced vocal fold vibration.",

    "abstract": "Human vocal folds experience flow-induced vibrations during phonation. In previous computational models, the vocal fold dynamics has been treated with linear elasticity theory in which both the strain and the displacement of the tissue are assumed to be infinitesimal (referred to as model I). The effect of the nonlinear strain, or geometric nonlinearity, caused by finite displacements is yet not clear. In this work, a two-dimensional model is used to study the effect of geometric nonlinearity (referred to as model II) on the vocal fold and the airflow. The result shows that even though the deformation is under 1\u2009mm, i.e., less than 10% of the size of the vocal fold, the geometric nonlinear effect is still significant. Specifically, model I underpredicts the gap width, the flow rate, and the impact stress on the medial surfaces as compared to model II. The study further shows that the differences are caused by the contact mechanics and, more importantly, the fluid-structure interaction that magnifies the error from the small-displacement assumption. The results suggest that using the large-displacement formulation in a computational model would be more appropriate for accurate simulations of the vocal fold dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Thin film photovoltaic cells are increasingly important for cost-effective solar energy harvesting. Layered SnS is a promising absorber material due to its high optical absorption in the visible and good doping characteristics. We use first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to study structures of low-index surfaces of SnS using stoichiometric and oxygen-containing structural models, in order to elucidate their possible effect on the efficiency of the photovoltaic device. We find that the surface energy is minimized for the surface with orientation parallel to the layer stacking direction. Compared to stoichiometric surfaces, the oxygen-containing surfaces exhibit fewer electronic states near the band gap. This reduction of near-gap surface states by oxygen should reduce recombination losses at grain boundaries and interfaces of the SnS absorber, and should be beneficial to the efficiency of the solar cell.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a volume of fluid (VoF)/projection method for simulating droplet-laden incompressible turbulent flows with uniform density and viscosity. The method is mass-conserving, wisp-free, and consistent (i.e., the VoF function, C, satisfies the condition 0 \u2a7d C \u2a7d 1). First, we present the results of the VoF method for tracking volumes of initially spherical shape and with zero surface tension in analytical velocity fields (linear translation, solid-body rotation, single-vortex flow, and Taylor\u2013Green vortex) and in incompressible isotropic turbulence at Re\u03bb0 = 75 and 190. These numerical tests show that (i) our VoF method is mass-conserving, consistent, and wisp-free; (ii) for a CFL number of 0.1, the VoF geometrical error has almost a second-order convergence rate for a mesh resolution with more than 10 grid points per diameter; (iii) in the isotropic turbulence case, a resolution of about 32 grid points per diameter of the sphere is required in order to limit the VoF geometrical error below 1%. Then, in order to simulate droplet-laden flows, we have adopted the continuum surface force (CSF) model to compute the surface tension force. We have modified the sequence of the VoF advection sweeps, and show that, in the case of droplet in a translating reference frame, the r.m.s. of the spurious currents is about 1% of the translating velocity. Finally, we present DNS results of fully-resolved droplet-laden incompressible isotropic turbulence at Re\u03bb0=75 using a computational mesh of 1024^3 grid points and 7000 droplets of Weber number Werms=0.5, and initial droplet diameter equal to the Taylor length-scale of turbulence.",

    "abstract": "Seismological modeling technologies are advancing to the stage of enabling fundamental simulation of earthquake fault ruptures, which offer new opportunities to simulate extreme ground motions for collapse safety assessment and earthquake scenarios for community resilience studies. With the goal toward establishing the reliability of simulated ground motions for performance-based engineering, this paper examines the response of a 20-story concrete moment frame building analyzed by nonlinear dynamic analysis under corresponding sets of recorded and simulated ground motions. The simulated ground motions were obtained through a larger validation study via the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform (BBP) that simulates magnitude 5.9 to 7.3 earthquakes. Spectral shape and significant duration are considered when selecting ground motions in the development of comparable sets of simulated and recorded ground motions. Structural response is examined at different intensity levels up to collapse, to investigate whether a statistically significant difference exists between the responses to simulated and recorded ground motions. Results indicate that responses to simulated and recorded ground motions are generally similar at intensity levels prior to observation of collapses. Collapse capacities are also in good agreement for this structure. However, when the structure was made more sensitive to effects of ground motion duration, the differences between observed collapse responses increased. Research is ongoing to illuminate reasons for the difference and whether there is a systematic bias in the results that can be traced back to the ground motion simulation techniques.",

Understanding such structure\u2013reactivity relationships is crucial for the optimization of industrial catalysts and the design of novel catalysts with enhanced properties. In this letter, we employ a combination of first-principles computations and large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations with highly accurate neural network potentials to study the equilibrium surface structure and composition of bimetallic Au/Cu nanoparticles (NPs), which have recently been of interest as stable and efficient CO2 reduction catalysts. We demonstrate that the inclusion of explicit water molecules at a first-principles level of accuracy is necessary to predict experimentally observed trends in Au/Cu NP surface composition; in particular, we find that Au-coated core\u2013shell NPs are thermodynamically favored in vacuum, independent of Au/Cu chemical potential and NP size, while NPs with mixed Au\u2013Cu surfaces are preferred in aqueous solution. Furthermore, we show that both CO and O2 adsorption energies differ significantly for NPs with the equilibrium surface composition found in water and those with the equilibrium surface composition found in vacuum, suggesting large changes in CO2 reduction activity. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding and being able to predict the effects of catalytic environment on catalyst structure and activity. In addition, they demonstrate that first-principles-based neural network potentials provide a promising approach for accurately investigating the relationships between solvent, surface composition and morphology, surface electronic structure, and catalytic activity in systems composed of thousands of atoms.",

    "abstract": "We study the biomechanical interactions between the lipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton in a red blood cell (RBC) by developing a general framework for mesoscopic simulations. We treated the lipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton as two distinct components and developed a unique whole-cell model of the RBC, using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). The model is validated by comparing the predicted results with measurements from four different and independent experiments. First, we simulated the micropipette aspiration and quantified the cytoskeletal deformation. Second, we studied the membrane fluctuations of healthy RBCs and RBCs parasitized to different intraerythrocytic stages by the malaria-inducing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Third, we subjected the RBC to shear flow and investigated the dependence of its tank-treading frequency on shear rate. Finally,we simulated the bilayer\u2013cytoskeletal detachment in channel flow to quantify the strength of such interactions when the corresponding bonds break. Taken together, these experiments and corresponding systematic DPD simulations probe the governing constitutive response of the cytoskeleton, elastic stiffness, viscous friction, and strength of bilayer\u2013cytoskeletal interactions as well as membrane viscosities. Hence, the DPD simulations and comparisons with available independent experiments serve as validation of the unique two-component model and lead to useful insights into the biomechanical interactions between the lipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton of the RBC. Furthermore, they provide a basis for further studies to probe cell mechanistic processes in health and disease in a manner that guides the design and interpretation of experiments and to develop simulations of phenomena that cannot be studied systematically by experiments alone.",

    "abstract": "This study is partially motivated by the validation of a new two-component multiscale cell model we developed recently that treats the lipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton as two distinct components. Here the whole cell model is validated and compared against several available experiments that examine the red blood cell (RBC) mechanics, rheology and dynamics. First, we investigated RBC deformability in a microfluidic channel with a very small cross-sectional area and quantified the mechanical properties of the RBC membrane. Second, we simulated twisting torque cytometry and compared predicted rheological properties of the RBC membrane with experimental measurements. Finally,we modeled the tank-treading (TT) motion of a RBC in a shear flow and explored the effect of channel width variations on the TT frequency. We also investigated the effects of bilayercytoskeletal interactions on these experiments and our simulations clearly indicated that they play key roles in the determination of cell membrane mechanical, rheological and dynamical properties. These simulations serve as validation tests and moreover reveal the capabilities and limitations of the new whole cellmodel.",

    "abstract": "Insertion\u2013deletion (indel) mutations are caused by strand slippage between pairing primer and template strands during nucleic acid strand extension. A possible causative factor for such strand slippage is base flipping in the primer strand or template strand, for insertion or deletion mutations, respectively. A simple mechanistic description is that the \u201chole\u201d in the nucleic acid duplex left behind by a flipping base is occupied by a neighboring base on the same strand, resulting in slippage with respect to its paired strand. The extent of single base flipping required for occupation of its former place in the double helix by a neighboring base is not fully understood. The present study uses restrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations along a pseudohedihedral base flipping parameter to construct two-dimensional free energy profiles along base flipping and strand slippage geometric parameters. These profiles, generated for both cytosine and guanine single base flipping in a short repetitive indel mutation hot-spot DNA sequence, illustrate the extent of single base flipping that can allow strand slippage by one base position. Relatively minor base flipping into both the major and minor grooves can result in strand slippage. Deconstruction of the collective variable strand slippage geometric parameter into its component distances illustrates the details of how strand slippage can accompany base flipping. The trans Watson\u2013Crick:sugar edge interaction that stabilizes cytosine flipping in this hot-spot sequence is also characterized energetically. The impact of these results on understanding sequence dependence of indel errors in nucleic acid strand extension is discussed, along with a suggestion for future studies that can generalize the present findings to all nearest-neighbor sequence contexts.",

Electrical control of magnetism is not only important for ultralow power consumption applications, but also enables control over intrinsic material properties that may have a major step in new developments in spintronic and magnetoelectric devices. Here we show that the magnetism induced by aryl-radicals covalently functionalized on top of multilayer graphene is sensitive to external electric fields which coupled to the interlayer charge-imbalance yields a strong magnetoelectric coupling. We used first-principles simulations, taking into account van der Waals dispersion forces, to show that this effect is thickness-dependent: it increases dramatically to thicker graphene structures reaching magnetoelectric coefficients comparable to perovskite interfaces. The interplay between electric fields and magnetism also leads functionalized graphene layers to a fully polarized spin state (half-metallicity). Efficiency nearly to 100% spin-polarization is observed at low electric bias, and the selection of the spin-conducting channel is determined by the field polarization.",

The focus is on Ti and Zr homogeneous olefin polymerization catalysts containing mixed cyclopentadienyl/aryloxide ligation. Polyolefins are widely used to make plastic bottles such as the ones pictured on this cover. The basic principles developed here extend to all kinds of catalysts.

We explore efficiency and scalability of incompressible flow computations using up to 256 GPUs on a problem with approximately 17.2 billion cells. Our work addresses some of the unique issues faced when merging fine-grain parallelism on the GPU using CUDA with coarse-grain parallelism that use either MPI or MPI-OpenMP for communications. We present three different strategies to overlap computations with communications, and systematically assess their impact on parallel performance on two different GPU clusters. Our results for strong and weak scaling analysis of incompressible flow computations demonstrate that GPU clusters offer significant benefits for large data sets, and a dual-level MPI-CUDA implementation with maximum overlapping of computation and communication provides substantial benefits in performance. We also find that our tri-level MPI-OpenMP-CUDA parallel implementation does not offer a significant advantage in performance over the dual-level implementation on GPU clusters with two GPUs per node, but on clusters with higher GPU counts per node or with different domain decomposition strategies a tri-level implementation may exhibit higher efficiency than a dual-level implementation and needs to be investigated further.",

We find that H- and F-functionalization brightens a low energy exciton that couples the SWCNT local-defect chemistry to its extended \u03c0 network. Surprisingly, the energy of the strongly light absorbing \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\u204e excitation (View the MathML source) and the Raman shift of the radial breathing mode (RBM) are not very sensitive to the presence of the defects, and to a lesser degree their type. In contrast, the RR intensities of the RBM resonance profile are reduced by two orders of magnitude upon functionalization due to changes in the dynamic polarizabilities. Additionally, the resonance profile shows sensitivity to the defect chemistry where the H-functionalized CNTs have a factor \u22484 larger intensities than F-functionalized CNTs in the near resonance region. Despite the differences in the nature of the local defects, our findings are in good agreement with recent experiments on individual SWCNTs with well controlled topological defects. The study shows that photoluminescence is not sensitive to low concentrations of defects, but RR spectroscopy provides a powerful ultra-sensitive tool to identify and categorize CNT defects.",

UltraScan supports its users with a scienti\ufb01c gateway in order to leverage the power of supercomputing. In this contribution, we will focus on several advancements of the UltraScan scienti\ufb01c gateway architecture with a standardized job management while retaining its lightweight design and end user interaction experience. This paper also present insights into a production deployment of UltraScan in Europe. The approach is based on open standards with respect to job management and submissions to the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment in the USA and to similar infrastructures in Europe such as the European Grid Infrastructure or the Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe (PRACE).

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayer ribbons have been performed to investigate the structures and line tensions associated with free bilayer edges. Simulations carried out for dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine with three different force-field parameter sets yielded edge line tensions of 45 \u00b1 2 pN, over 50% greater than the most recently reported experimentally determined value for this lipid. Edge tensions obtained from simulations of a series of phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer ribbons with saturated acyl tails of length 12\u201316 carbons and with monounsaturated acyl tails of length 14\u201318 carbons could be correlated with the excess area associated with forming the edge, through a two-parameter fit. Saturated-tail lipids underwent local thickening near the edge, producing denser packing that correlated with lower line tensions, while unsaturated-tail lipids showed little or no local thickening. In a dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ribbon initiated in a tilted gel-phase structure, lipid headgroups tended to tilt toward the nearer edge producing a herringbone pattern, an accommodation that may account for the reported edge-induced stabilization of an ordered structure at temperatures near a lipid gel-fluid phase transition.",

    "abstract": "We carry out adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulations of Milky Way mass halos in order to investigate the formation of disk-like galaxies in a \u039b-dominated cold dark matter model. We evolve a suite of five halos to z = 0 and find a gas disk formation in each; however, in agreement with previous smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations (that did not include a subgrid feedback model), the rotation curves of all halos are centrally peaked due to a massive spheroidal component. Our standard model includes radiative cooling and star formation, but no feedback. We further investigate this angular momentum problem by systematically modifying various simulation parameters including: (1) spatial resolution, ranging from 1700 to 212 pc; (2) an additional pressure component to ensure that the Jeans length is always resolved; (3) low star formation efficiency, going down to 0.1%; (4) fixed physical resolution as opposed to comoving resolution; (5) a supernova feedback model that injects thermal energy to the local cell; and (6) a subgrid feedback model which suppresses cooling in the immediate vicinity of a star formation event. Of all of these, we find that only the last (cooling suppression) has any impact on the massive spheroidal component. In particular, a simulation with cooling suppression and feedback results in a rotation curve that, while still peaked, is considerably reduced from our standard runs.",

    "abstract": "In gene, protein, and RNA families, it is typical for bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic members to form separate clusters. In this paper we report and analyze both phylogenetically and structurally a different pattern in the HCN/CNG family of ion channels, in which two subsets of bacterial members of the family clusters with eukaryotic members, rather than with the other bacterial members. The most parsimonious interpretation of the phylogeny is that this pattern is a consequence of horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryotic organism into a bacterium. We term the bacterial descendants of such transfer Eukaryotic-Like HCN/CNG's (ELHCN/CNG's). All of the ELHCN/CNG's have typical potassium channel selectivity filters. Thus in that sense they are more similar to HCN's than CNG's. However by more global similarity measures, they are roughly equally distant from the HCN's and CNG's, suggesting that the eukaryote-to-bacteria horizontal transfer was of a common ancestor to both the HCN's and CNG's. Our phylogenetic analysis further suggests that among the bacteria, subsequent spread of these two subsets was as much by horizontal transfer as by lineal descent. One possible mechanism for such transfer is amoeba, for which there is evidence that they engage in horizontal transfer with bacteria, and also facilitate horizontal transfer among bacteria. The ELHCN/CNG's may be useful biophysical and functional models for eukaryotic members of this family, especially because they share with the eukaryotic members a long C-linker between the inner helix of the permeation pathway and the ligand binding sites in the cyclic nucleotide binding domain. We present a model-built structure of one of the ELHCN/CNG's, which suggests a mechanism for coupling of ligand binding with channel opening.",

    "abstract": "Atom Probe Tomography (APT) represents a revolutionary characterization tool that allows direct-space three-dimensional, atomic-scale resolution imaging along with the chemical identities of each detected atom. Quantitative analysis of APT data to perform characterization of precipitates in alloys gives clear insights into the structure\u2013property relationships and helps in achieving the larger goal of materials-by-design. Most techniques currently used to extract precipitate topology and interface information from APT data are efficient; however, they are based on homogenization of the rich point cloud data which is inherently lossy. Furthermore, these methods require a specified, usually heuristic, concentration-level to draw iso-contours in order to extract characteristics of the precipitate topology. These twin issues of homogenization and heuristics are compelling rationale for the development of a robust, scalable, heuristic-free, graph-based framework, which we call Graph methods for Precipitate Topology Characterization (GraPTop). This framework is motivated by the equivalence between a 3D point cloud data of atoms and an undirected, weighted, labeled graph. By considering the 3D point cloud data as an undirected, weighted, labeled graph, we leverage powerful graph-based algorithms to identify the local topology of precipitates without the necessity of any heuristics. Since GraPTop is based on nearly linear-complexity graph-algorithms, it is scalable to extremely large datasets. Furthermore, the performance of this framework is insensitive to the complexity of the geometry or the number of the precipitates in the point cloud data. We showcase this framework by analyzing several regions of interest in a point cloud Al\u2013Mg\u2013Sc (Aluminium\u2013Magnesium\u2013Scandium) specimen APT data and extract several interesting measures describing the precipitate topology like area, volume, and nonconvexity.",

This is a non-trivial generalization of the work recently published on dimer adsorption onM-sites wide square terraces, with first- and second-neighbor adsorbate-adsorbate interaction energies. As the rank of the transfer matrix increases rapidly with size M, the algorithm designed for its construction, at any temperature of the system, and for all possible values of the interaction energies, is efficient and ideally adapted for multiparallel processing. An overview of the source code implementing the algorithm is also presented, and it is used to generate the low temperature energy phase diagram for infinitely long,M = 6 nanotube.",

    "abstract": "Electrical current flow within populations of neurons is a fundamental constituent of brain function. The resulting fluctuating magnetic fields may be sampled noninvasively with an array of magnetic field detectors positioned outside a patient\u2019s head. This is magnetoencephalography (MEG). Each source may be characterized by 5-6 parameters, the xyz location and the xyz direction. The magnetic field measurements are nonlinear in the location parameters; hence the source location is identifiable only via search of the brain volume. When there is one or a very few sources, this may be practical; solutions for the general problem are weak. Referee consensus is a new method which enables identification of one source at a time regardless of the number and location of others. This \u201cindependence\u201d enables solution of the general problem and insures suitability to grid computing. The computation scales linearly with the number of nonlinear parameters. MEG recordings were obtained from volunteers while they performed a cognitive task The recordings were processed on the Open Science Grid (\u2248150 CPU hours/sec of data). On average 500-1500 sources were active throughout. Statistical analyses demonstrated",

    "abstract": "A dynamic global-coefficient mixed subgrid-scale eddy-viscosity model for large-eddy simulation of turbulent flows in complex geometries is developed. In the present model, the subgrid-scale stress is decomposed into the modified Leonard stress, cross stress, and subgrid-scale Reynolds stress. The modified Leonard stress is explicitly computed assuming a scale similarity, while the cross stress and the subgrid- scale Reynolds stress are modeled using the global-coefficient eddy-viscosity model. The model coefficient is determined by a dynamic procedure based on the global-equilibrium between the subgrid- scale dissipation and the viscous dissipation. The new model relieves some of the difficulties associated with an eddy-viscosity closure, such as the nonalignment of the principal axes of the subgrid-scale stress tensor and the strain rate tensor and the anisotropy of turbulent flow fields, while, like other dynamic global-coefficient models, it does not require averaging or clipping of the model coefficient for numerical stabilization. The combination of the global-coefficient eddy-viscosity model and a scalesimilarity model is demonstrated to produce improved predictions in a number of turbulent flow simulations.",

    "abstract": "Protein structure refinement aims to perform a set of operations given a predicted structure to improve model quality and accuracy with respect to the native in a blind fashion. Despite the numerous computational approaches to the protein refinement problem reported in the previous three CASPs, an overwhelming majority of methods degrade models rather than improve them. We initially developed a method tested using blind predictions during CASP10 which was officially ranked in 5th place among all methods in the refinement category. Here, we present Princeton_TIGRESS, which when benchmarked on all CASP 7,8,9, and 10 refinement targets, simultaneously increased GDT_TS 76% of the time with an average improvement of 0.83 GDT_TS points per structure. The method was additionally benchmarked on models produced by top performing three-dimensional structure prediction servers during CASP10. The robustness of the Princeton_TIGRESS protocol was also tested for different random seeds. We make the Princeton_TIGRESS refinement protocol freely available as a web server at http://atlas.princeton.edu/refinement. Using this protocol, one can consistently refine a prediction to help bridge the gap between a predicted structure and the actual native structure.",

    "abstract": "Solvent-based thin-film deposition constitutes a popular class of fabrication strategies for manufacturing organic electronic devices like organic solar cells. All such solvent-based techniques usually involve preparing dilute blends of electron-donor and electron-acceptor materials dissolved in a volatile solvent. After some form of coating onto a substrate to form a thin film, the solvent evaporates. An initially homogeneous mixture separates into electron-acceptor rich and electron-donor rich regions as the solvent evaporates. Depending on the specifics of the blend, processing conditions, and substrate characteristics different morphologies are typically formed. Experimental evidence consistently confirms that the resultant morphology critically affects device performance. A computational framework that can predict morphology evolution can significantly augment experimental analysis. Such a framework will also allow high throughput analysis of the large phase space of processing parameters, thus yielding considerable insight into the process\u2013structure\u2013property relationships governing organic solar cell behavior. In this paper, we formulate a computational framework to predict evolution of morphology during solvent-based fabrication of organic thin films. This is accomplished by developing a phase field-based model of evaporation-induced and substrate-induced phase-separation in ternary systems. This formulation allows most of the important physical phenomena affecting morphology evolution during fabrication to be naturally incorporated. We discuss the various numerical and computational challenges associated with a three dimensional, finite-element based, massively parallel implementation of this framework. This formulation allows, for the first time, to model three-dimensional nanomorphology evolution over large time spans on device scale domains. We illustrate this framework by investigating and quantifying the effect of various process and system variables on morphology evolution. We explore ways to control the morphology evolution by investigating different evaporation rates, blend ratios and interaction parameters between components.",

The dynamics of the energy gap between the donor and acceptor states include slow components, on the time-scale of tens of nanoseconds. These slow time-scales are related to large-scale elastic motions of the membrane-bound protein complex, which modulate both electrostatic and induction interactions of the electron with the protein\u2013water\u2013lipid thermal bath. The combined effect of these interactions is a high, 5 eV, reorganization energy of electron transfer as calculated from their variance. The reorganization energy does not reach equilibrium on the length of simulations and the system is nonergodic on this time-scale. To account for nonergodicity, two reorganization energies are required to describe the activation barrier, and their ratio is tuned by the relative time-scales of nuclear reorganization and of the reaction.",

    "abstract": "The structural properties of water molecules surrounding TMAO molecules are studied using a newly developed atomistic force field for TMAO, combined with a multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) force field derived from the atomistic simulations. The all-atom force field is parametrized to work with the OPLS force field and with SPC, TIP3P, and TIP4P water models. The dual-resolution modeling enables a complete study of the dynamical and structural properties of the system, with the CG model providing important new physical insights into which interactions are critical in determining the structure of water around TMAO. TMAO is an osmolyte that stabilizes protein structures under conditions of chemical, thermal, and pressure denaturation. This molecule is excluded from the surface of proteins, and its effect on protein stability is mediated through TMAO\u2013water interactions. We find that TMAO strongly binds two to three water molecules and, surprisingly, that methyl groups repel both the other methyl groups of TMAO and water molecules alike. The latter result is important because it shows that methyl groups are not interacting with each other through the expected hydrophobic effect (which would be attractive and not repulsive) and that the repulsion of water molecules forces a clathrate-like hydrogen bond network around them. We speculate that TMAO is excluded from the vicinity of the protein because the peculiar structure of water around TMAO prevents this molecule from coming in close contact with the protein.",

The twentieth century CCSM4 run is compared with the warmest twenty-first century projection (representative concentration pathway 8.5, or RCP8.5). The last 20 years of each simulation are compared in their MJO characteristics, including spatial variance distributions of winds, precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation, histograms of event amplitude, phase and duration, and composite maps of phases. The RCP8.5 run exhibits increased variance in intraseasonal precipitation, larger-amplitude MJO events, stronger MJO rainfall in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, and a greater frequency of MJO occurrence for phases corresponding to enhanced rainfall in the Indian Ocean sector. These features are consistent with the concept of an increased magnitude for the hydrological cycle under greenhouse warming conditions. Conversely, the number of active MJO days decreases and fewer weak MJO events occur in the future climate state. These results motivate further study of these changes since tropical rainfall variability plays such an important role in the region\u2019s socio-economic well being.",

    "abstract": "Fusion peptides from influenza hemagglutinin act on membranes to promote membrane fusion, but the mechanism by which they do so remains unknown. Recent theoretical work has suggested that contact of protruding lipid tails may be an important feature of the transition state for membrane fusion. If this is so, then influenza fusion peptides would be expected to promote tail protrusion in proportion to the ability of the corresponding full-length hemagglutinin to drive lipid mixing in fusion assays. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of influenza fusion peptides in lipid bilayers, comparing the X-31 influenza strain against a series of N-terminal mutants. As hypothesized, the probability of lipid tail protrusion correlates well with the lipid mixing rate induced by each mutant. This supports the conclusion that tail protrusion is important to the transition state for fusion. Furthermore, it suggests that tail protrusion can be used to examine how fusion peptides might interact with membranes to promote fusion. Previous models for native influenza fusion peptide structure in membranes include a kinked helix, a straight helix, and a helical hairpin. Our simulations visit each of these conformations. Thus, the free energy differences between each are likely low enough that specifics of the membrane environment and peptide construct may be sufficient to modulate the equilibrium between them. However, the kinked helix promotes lipid tail protrusion in our simulations much more strongly than the other two structures. We therefore predict that the kinked helix is the most fusogenic of these three conformations.",

    "abstract": "Oceanic observations collected during the VOCALS-REx cruise time period, 1\u201330 November 2008, are assimilated into a regional ocean model (ROMS) using 4DVAR and then analyzed for their dynamics. Nonlinearities in the system prevent a complete 30-day fit, so two 15-day fits for 1\u201315 November and 16\u201330 November are executed using the available observations of hydrographic temperature and salinity, along with satellite fields of SST and sea-level height anomaly. The fits converge and reduce the cost function significantly, and the results indicated that ROMS is able to successfully reproduce both large-scale and smaller-scale features of the flows observed during the VOCALS-REx cruise. Particular attention is focused on an intensively studied eddy at 76\u00b0 W, 19\u00b0 S. The ROMS fits capture this eddy as an isolated rotating 3-D vortex with a strong subsurface signature in velocity, temperature and anomalously low salinity. The eddy has an average temperature anomaly of approximately \u22120.5 \u00b0C over a depth range from 50\u2013600 m and features a cold anomaly of approximately \u22121 \u00b0C near 150 m depth. The eddy moves northwestward and elongates during the second 15-day fit. It exhibits a strong signature in the Okubo-Weiss parameter, which indicates significant nonlinearity in its evolution. The heat balance for the period of the cruise from the ocean state estimate reveals that the horizontal advection and the vertical mixing processes are the dominant terms that balance the temperature tendency of the upper layer of the ocean locally in time and space. Areal averages around the eddies, for a 15-day period during the cruise, suggest that vertical mixing processes generally balance the surface heating. Although, this indicates only a small role for lateral advective processes in this region during this period, this quasi-instantaneous heat budget analysis cannot be extended to interpret the seasonal or long-term upper ocean heat budget in this region.",

    "abstract": "Understanding ion relaxation dynamics in overlapping electric double layers (EDLs) is critical for the development of efficient nanotechnology based electrochemical energy storage, electrochemomechanical energy conversion and bioelectrochemical sensing devices besides controlled synthesis of nanostructured materials. Here, using Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, we present results from the simulations of an electrolytic nanocapacitor subjected to a step potential at t = 0 for various degrees of EDL overlap, solvent viscosities, ratios of cation to anion diffusivity and electrode separations. A continuously varying molecular speed dependent relaxation time, proposed for use with the LB equation, recovers the correct microscopic description of molecular collision phenomena and holds promise for enhancing the stability of the LB algorithm. Results for large EDL overlap showed oscillatory behavior for ionic current densities in contrast to monotonic relaxation to equilibrium for low EDL overlap. Further, at low solvent viscosities and large EDL overlap, anomalous plasma-like spatial oscillations of electric field were observed that appeared to be purely an effect of nanoscale confinement.",

The accuracy of heliospheric models can be improved by using realistic boundary conditions and confirming the results with in situ spacecraft measurements. To accurately reproduce the solar wind (SW) plasma flow near Earth, we need realistic, time-dependent boundary conditions at a fixed distance from the Sun. We may prepare such boundary conditions using SW speed and density determined from interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations, magnetic field derived from photospheric magnetograms, and temperature estimated from its correlation with SW speed. Here, we present the time-dependent MHD simulation results obtained by using the 2011 IPS data from the Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory as time-varying inner boundary conditions and compare the simulated data at Earth with OMNI data (spacecraft-interspersed, near-Earth solar wind data).",

    "abstract": "We revisit the time-resolved photoemission in neon atoms as probed by attosecond streaking. We calculate streaking time shifts for the emission of 2p and 2s electrons and compare the relative delay as measured in a recent experiment by Schultze et al. [Science 328, 1658 (2010)]. The B-spline R-matrix method is employed to calculate accurate Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith time delays from multielectron dipole transition matrix elements for photoionization. The additional laser field-induced time shifts in the exit channel are obtained from separate, time-dependent simulations of a full streaking process by solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the single-active-electron level. The resulting accurate total relative streaking time shifts between 2s and 2p emission lie well below the experimental data. We identify the presence of unresolved shake-up satellites in the experiment as a potential source of error in the determination of streaking time shifts.",

    "abstract": "We present the first numerical simulations that self-consistently follow the formation of dense molecular clouds in colliding flows. Our calculations include a time-dependent model for the H2 and CO chemistry that runs alongside a detailed treatment of the dominant heating and cooling processes in the interstellar medium. We adopt initial conditions characteristic of the warm neutral medium and study two different flow velocities \u2013 a slow flow with vflow = 6.8\u2009km\u2009s\u22121 and a fast flow with vflow = 13.6\u2009km\u2009s\u22121. The clouds formed by the collision of these flows form stars, with star formation beginning after 16\u2009Myr in the case of the slower flow, but after only 4.4\u2009Myr in the case of the faster flow. In both flows, the formation of CO-dominated regions occurs only around 2\u2009Myr before the onset of star formation. Prior to this, the clouds produce very little emission in the J = 1\u20130 transition line of CO and would probably not be identified as molecular clouds in observational surveys. In contrast, our models show that H2-dominated regions can form much earlier, with the timing depending on the details of the flow. In the case of the slow flow, small pockets of gas become fully molecular around 10\u2009Myr before star formation begins, while in the fast flow, the first H2-dominated regions occur around 3\u2009Myr before the first pre-stellar cores form. Our results are consistent with models of molecular cloud formation in which the clouds are dominated by \u2018;dark\u2019 molecular gas for a considerable proportion of their assembly history.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the influence of jet rotation and differential motion on the linear and nonlinear development of the current-driven (CD) kink instability of force-free helical magnetic equilibria via three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In this study, we follow the temporal development within a periodic computational box. Displacement of the initial helical magnetic field leads to the growth of the CD kink instability. We find that, in accordance with the linear stability theory, the development of the instability depends on the lateral distribution of the poloidal magnetic field. If the poloidal field significantly decreases outward from the axis, then the initial small perturbations grow strongly, and if multiple wavelengths are excited, then nonlinear interaction eventually disrupts the initial cylindrical configuration. When the profile of the poloidal field is shallow, the instability develops slowly and eventually saturates. We briefly discuss implications of our findings for Poynting-dominated jets.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the applicability of the unsupervised machine learning technique of self-organizing maps (SOM) to estimate galaxy photometric redshift probability density functions (PDFs). This technique takes a spectroscopic training set, and maps the photometric attributes, but not the redshifts, to a two-dimensional surface by using a process of competitive learning where neurons compete to more closely resemble the training data multidimensional space. The key feature of a SOM is that it retains the topology of the input set, revealing correlations between the attributes that are not easily identified. We test three different 2D topological mapping: rectangular, hexagonal and spherical, by using data from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 survey. We also explore different implementations and boundary conditions on the map and also introduce the idea of a random atlas, where a large number of different maps are created and their individual predictions are aggregated to produce a more robust photometric redshift PDF. We also introduced a new metric, the I-score, which efficiently incorporates different metrics, making it easier to compare different results (from different parameters or different photometric redshift codes). We find that by using a spherical topology mapping we obtain a better representation of the underlying multidimensional topology, which provides more accurate results that are comparable to other, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Our results illustrate that unsupervised approaches have great potential for many astronomical problems, and in particular for the computation of photometric redshifts.",

    "abstract": "With the growth of large photometric surveys, accurately estimating photometric redshifts, preferably as a probability density function (PDF), and fully understanding the implicit systematic uncertainties in this process, has become increasingly important. In this paper, we present a new, publicly available, parallel, machine learning algorithm that generates photometric redshift PDFs by using prediction trees and random forest techniques, which we have named TPZ.1 This new algorithm incorporates measurement errors into the calculation while also dealing efficiently with missing values in the data. In addition, our implementation of this algorithm provides supplementary information regarding the data being analysed, including unbiased estimates of the accuracy of the technique without resorting to a validation data set, identification of poor photometric redshift areas within the parameter space occupied by the spectroscopic training data, a quantification of the relative importance of the variables used to construct the PDF, and a robust identification of outliers. This extra information can be used to optimally target new spectroscopic observations and to improve the overall efficacy of the redshift estimation. We have tested TPZ on galaxy samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample and from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe-2 (DEEP2) survey, obtaining excellent results in each case. We also have tested our implementation by participating in the PHAT1 project, which is a blind photometric redshift contest, finding that TPZ performs comparable to if not better than other empirical photometric redshift algorithms. Finally, we discuss the various parameters that control the operation of TPZ, the specific limitations of this approach and an application of photometric redshift PDFs.",

    "abstract": "SR141716A binds selectively to the brain cannabinoid (CB1) receptor and exhibits a potent inverse agonist/antagonist activity. Although SR141716A, also known as rimonabant, has been withdrawn from the market due to severe side effects, there remains interest in some of its many potential medical applications. Consequently, it is imperative to understand the mechanism by which SR141716A exerts its inverse agonist activity. As a result of using an approach combining mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations, we determined the binding mode of SR141716A. We found from the simulation of the CB1-SR141716A complex that SR141716A projects toward TM5 to interact tightly with the major binding pocket, replacing the coordinated water molecules, and secures the Trp-356(6.48) rotameric switch in the inactive state to promote the formation of an extensive water-mediated H-bonding network to the highly conserved SLAXAD and NPXXY motifs in TM2/TM7. We identify for the first time the involvement of the minor binding pocket formed by TM2/TM3/TM7 for SR141716A binding, which complements the major binding pocket formed by TM3/TM5/TM6. Simulation of the F174(2.61)A mutant CB1-SR141716A complex demonstrates the perturbation of TM2 that attenuates SR141716A binding indirectly. These results suggest SR141716A exerts inverse agonist activity through the stabilization of both TM2 and TM5, securing the Trp-356(6.48) rotameric switch and restraining it from activation.",

    "abstract": "The bridge -helix in the ' subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP) borders the active site and may have roles in catalysis and translocation. In Escherichia coli RNAP, a bulky hydrophobic segment near the N-terminal end of the bridge helix is identified (beta' 772-YFI-774; the YFI motif). YFI is located at a distance from the active center and adjacent to a glycine hinge (beta' 778-GARKG-782) involved in dynamic bending of the bridge helix. Remarkably, amino acid substitutions in YFI significantly alter intrinsic termination, pausing, fidelity and translocation of RNAP. F773V RNAP largely ignores the lambda tR2 terminator at 200 microM NTPs and is strongly reduced in lambda tR2 recognition at 1 microM NTPs. F773V alters RNAP pausing and backtracking and favors misincorporation. By contrast, the adjacent Y772A substitution increases fidelity and exhibits other transcriptional defects generally opposite to those of F773V. All atom molecular dynamics simulation revealed two separate functional connections emanating from YFI explaining the distinct effects of substitutions: Y772 communicates with the active site through the link domain in the beta subunit, whereas F773 communicates through the fork domain in the beta subunit. I774 interacts with the F-loop, which also contacts the glycine hinge of the bridge helix. These results identified negative and positive circuits coupled at YFI and employed for regulation of catalysis, elongation, termination and translocation.",

    "abstract": "The sequence-dependent binding of proteins to DNA often depends on both on the architecture of the whole protein (e.g. the helix-turn-helix motif) as well as on specific recognition elements within the protein (e.g. the recognition helix). In order to understand the extent to which the recognition helices of the gal and lac repressor proteins confer sequence specificity in protein-DNA binding, we have performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations of these helices in complex with both specific and non-specific DNA. Our simulations indicate that changing two amino acids in the protein or one base of the DNA can lead to a dramatic loss of sequence specificity. By analyzing atomic fluctuations, protein-DNA interaction energies, and hydrogen bonding patterns, we gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of sequence-specific protein-DNA interactions. Our results provide strategies to guide the development of nanomedicines that can be designed to target specific sequences of DNA.",

    "abstract": "GCN4 is a basic leucine zipper protein and is the main regulator of the transcriptional response to amino acid starvation in yeast. When bound to DNA, a \u201cchopstick-shape\u201d is formed and an antagonistic folding occurs. By performing computer simulations on the 100ns timescale, we are able to understand how GCN4 recognizes these DNA sequences. To understand the interactions responsible for sequence-specific binding, we are analyzing: hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, RMSF, RMSD, and patterns in atomic fluctuations. Through running these specific analyses, we can conclude why these proteins bind the way they do. In the future, this will lead to continuing investigation in specific mutations and how they affect protein binding.",

    "abstract": "The effect of bending buckling of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on thermal conductivity of CNT materials is investigated in atomistic and mesoscopic simulations. Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of the thermal conductance through an individual buckling kink in a (10,10) single-walled CNT reveal a strong dependence (close to inverse proportionality) of the thermal conductance of the buckling kink on the buckling angle. The value of the buckling kink conductance divided by the cross-sectional area of the CNT ranges from 40 to 10 GWm-2K-1 as the buckling angle changes from 20 to 110 degrees. The predictions of the atomistic simulations are used for parameterization of a mesoscopic model that enables calculations of thermal conductivity of \ufb01lms composed of thousands of CNTs arranged into continuous networks of bundles. The results of mesoscopic simulations demonstrate that the conductivity of CNT \ufb01lms is sensitive to the angular dependence of the buckling kink conductance and the length of the individual CNTs. For a \ufb01lm composed of 1 mkm-long CNTs, the values of the in-plane \ufb01lm conductivity predicted with a constant conductance of 20 GWm-2K-1 and the angular-dependent conductance obtained in atomistic simulations are about 40 and 20% lower than the conductivity predicted for the same \ufb01lm with zero thermal resistance of the buckling kinks, respectively. The weaker impact of the angular-dependent buckling kink conductance on the effective conductivity of the \ufb01lm is explained by the presence of a large fraction of kinks that have small buckling angles and correspondingly large values of conductance. The results of the simulations suggest that the \ufb01nite conductance of the buckling kinks has a moderate, but non-negligible, effect on thermal conductivity of materials composed of short CNTs with length up to 1 mkm. The contribution of the buckling kink thermal resistance becomes stronger for materials composed of longer CNTs and/or characterized by higher density of buckling kinks.",

The material response to the irradiation by a 200 fs laser pulse is studied for laser fluences covering the regimes of melting and recrystallization of the surface region of the target, photomechanical separation (spallation) of a liquid layer, and explosive disintegration and ejection of a superheated surface region. The transition from the regime of transient surface melting to the spallation is manifested by a sharp increase of the total amount of ejected material (ablation yield) and decrease in the time required for resolidification of the surface region of the target. The transition from the spallation to the phase explosion regime is characterized by a remarkable change in the composition of the ejected ablation plume (smaller droplets and larger fraction of vapor phase), increase in the time for surface resolidification, and saturation or even decrease of the total ablation yield as compared to the spallation regime. The conditions that control the transitions between the three regimes and the mechanisms of laser melting, spallation and phase explosion are established for the chromium target and related to the results of earlier simulations performed for other metals and molecular systems.",

An analytical equation for quantitative description of the effect of \ufb01nite kT on the value of k is obtained and adopted for continuous networks of bundles characteristic of CNT \ufb01lms and buckypaper.

    "abstract": "This paper shows demonstrable improvement in the global seasonal climate predictability of boreal summer (at zero lead) and fall (at one season lead) seasonal mean precipitation and surface temperature from a twotiered seasonal hindcast forced with forecasted SST relative to two other contemporary operational coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere climate models. The results from an extensive set of seasonal hindcasts are analyzed to come to this conclusion. This improvement is attributed to: (1) The multi-model bias corrected SST used to force the atmospheric model. (2) The global atmospheric model which is run at a relatively high resolution of 50 km grid resolution compared to the two other coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere models. (3) The physics of the atmospheric model, especially that related to the convective parameterization scheme. The results of the seasonal hindcast are analyzed for both deterministic and probabilistic skill. The probabilistic skill analysis shows that signi\ufb01cant forecast skill can be harvested from these seasonal hindcasts relative to the deterministic skill analysis. The paper concludes that the coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere seasonal hindcasts have reached a reasonable \ufb01delity to exploit their SST anomaly forecasts to force such relatively higher resolution two tier prediction experiments to glean further boreal summer and fall seasonal prediction skill.",

Simulations of CRL in water were also included for comparison, bringing the aggregate simulation time to over 2.8 \u03bcs. At both 310 and 375 K the ILs significantly dampen protein dynamics and trap the system near its starting structure. Structural changes in the enzyme follow the viscosity of the solvent, with the enzyme deviating from its initial structure the most in water and the least in BMIM-PF6. Interactions between the enzyme surface and the solvent in the IL simulations show that contacts are dominated by the IL anion, which is ascribed to a broader spatial distribution of positively charged protein residues and reduced mobility of the cation due to the size of the imadazolium ring.",

    "abstract": "We present a new first-order approach to strain-engineering of graphene's electronic structure where no continuous displacement field u(x,y) is required. The approach is valid for negligible curvature. The theory is directly expressed in terms of atomic displacements under mechanical load, such that one can determine if mechanical strain is varying smoothly at each unit cell, and the extent to which sublattice symmetry holds. Since strain deforms lattice vectors at each unit cell, orthogonality between lattice and reciprocal lattice vectors leads to renormalization of the reciprocal lattice vectors as well, making the K and K\u2032 points shift in opposite directions. From this observation we conclude that no K-dependent gauges enter on a first-order theory. In this formulation of the theory the deformation potential and pseudo-magnetic field take discrete values at each graphene unit cell. We illustrate the formalism by providing strain-generated fields and local density of electronic states on graphene membranes with large numbers of atoms. The present method complements and goes beyond the prevalent approach, where strain engineering in graphene is based upon first-order continuum elasticity.",

Our analysis reveals: (a) The two-tier forecast system has seasonal prediction skill for precipitation that is comparable (over the Southeast Asian monsoon) or even higher (over the South Asian monsoon) than the coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere. For seasonal anomalies of the surface temperature the results are more comparable across models, with all of them showing higher skill than that for precipitation. (b) Despite the improvement from the uncoupled AGCM all models in this study display a deterministic skill for seasonal precipitation anomalies over the Asian summer monsoon region to be weak. But there is useful probabilistic skill for tercile anomalies of precipitation and surface temperature that could be harvested from both the coupled and the uncoupled climate models. (c) Seasonal predictability of the South Asian summer monsoon (rainfall and temperature) does seem to stem from the remote ENSO forcing especially over the Indian monsoon region and the relatively weaker seasonal predictability in the Southeast Asian summer monsoon could be related to the comparatively weaker teleconnection with ENSO. The uncoupled AGCM with the bias corrected SST is able to leverage this teleconnection for improved seasonal prediction skill of the South Asian monsoon relative to the coupled models which display large systematic errors of the tropical SST\u2019s.",

The comparison of the hindcast skills of precipitation and surface temperature from FISH50 with the coupled ocean\u2013 atmosphere models reveals that the probabilistic skill is nearly comparable in the two types of forecast systems (with some improvements in FISH50 outside of the global tropics). Furthermore the drop in skill in going from zero lead (boreal winter) to one season lead (boreal spring) is also similar in FISH50 and the coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere models. Both the forecast systems also show that surface temperature hindcasts have more skill than the precipitation hindcasts and that land based precipitation hindcasts have slightly lower skill than the corresponding hindcasts over the ocean.",

For few layer thicknesses, the near degeneracies of the conduction band K and \u03a3 valleys and the valence band \u0393 and K valleys enhance the n-type and p-type thermoelectric performance. The interlayer hybridization and energy level splitting determine how the number of modes within kT of a valley minimum changes with layer thickness. In all cases, the maximum ZT coincides with the greatest near-degeneracy within kT of the band edge that results in the sharpest turn-on of the density of modes. The thickness at which this maximum occurs is, in general, not a monolayer. The transition from few layers to bulk is discussed.

    "abstract": "Over the recent years chirped-pulse, Fourier-transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectrometers have changed the scope of rotational spectroscopy. The broad frequency and large dynamic range make possible structural determinations in molecular systems of increasingly larger size from measurements of heavy atom (13C, 15N, 18O) isotopes recorded in natural abundance in the same spectrum as that of the parent isotopic species. The design of a broadband spectrometer operating in the 2\u20138 GHz frequency range with further improvements in sensitivity is presented. The current CP-FTMW spectrometer performance is benchmarked in the analyses of the rotational spectrum of the water heptamer, (H2O)7, in both 2\u2013 8 GHz and 6\u201318 GHz frequency ranges. Two isomers of the water heptamer have been observed in a pulsed supersonic molecular expansion. High level ab initio structural searches were performed to pro- vide plausible low-energy candidates which were directly compared with accurate structures provided from broadband rotational spectra. The full substitution structure of the most stable species has been obtained through the analysis of all possible singly-substituted isotopologues (H218O and HDO), and a least-squares rm(1) geometry of the oxygen framework determined from 16 different isotopic species compares with the calculated O\u2013O equilibrium distances at the 0.01 A\u030a level.",

    "abstract": "We have studied the structure and stability of H3O+(H2O)8 clusters using a combination of molecular dynamics sampling and high-level ab initio calculations. 20 distinct oxygen frameworks are found within 2 kcal/mol of the electronic or standard Gibbs free energy minimum. The impact of quantum zero-point vibrational corrections on the relative stability of these isomers is quite significant. The box-like isomers are favored in terms of electronic energy, but with the inclusion of zero-point vibrational corrections and entropic effects tree-like isomers are favored at higher temperatures. Under conditions from 0 to 298.15 K, the global minimum is predicted to be a tree-like structure with one dangling singly coordinated water molecule. Above 298.15 K, higher entropy tree-like isomers with two or more singly coordinated water molecules are favored. These assignments are generally consistent with experimental IR spectra of (H3O+)(H2O)8 obtained at \udbff\udc06150 K.",

    "abstract": "The first stars in the universe, termed Population III, are thought to have been very massive compared to the stars that form in the present epoch. As feedback from the first generation of stars altered the contents of the interstellar medium, the universe switched to a low-mass mode of star formation, which continues in the high-metallicity stars formed in the present era. Several studies have investigated the transition between metal-free and metal-enriched star formation, with tentative evidence being found for a metallicity threshold near 10\u20133.5 Z \u2609 due to atomic and molecular transitions and another threshold near 10\u20135.5 Z \u2609 due to dust. In this work, we simulate the fragmentation of cooling gas in idealized, low-metallicity halos using the adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo. We conduct several simulations of 106 M \u2609 and 107 M \u2609 halos at z = 20 in which the metal content, initial rotation, and degree of turbulence are varied in order to study the effect of these properties on gas fragmentation over a range of densities. We find tentative support for the idea of a critical metallicity, but the effect of varying metallicity on the gas we observe is not as dramatic as what has been reported in earlier studies. It is theorized that at lower redshifts with a lower cosmic microwave background temperature, variations in metallicity might have a larger effect on cooling and fragmentation. We find no clear relation between the initial spin or the initial level of turbulence in the halo and the final properties of the gas contained therein. Additionally, we find that the degree to which the Jeans length is refined, the initial density profile of the gas, and the inclusion of deuterium chemistry each have a significant effect on the evolution and fragmentation of the gas in the halo\u2014in particular, we find that at least 64 grid cells are needed to cover the Jeans length in order to properly resolve the fragmentation.",

    "abstract": "Simulations of galaxy clusters have a difficult time reproducing the radial gas-property gradients and red central galaxies observed to exist in the cores of galaxy clusters. Thermal conduction has been suggested as a mechanism that can help bring simulations of cluster cores into better alignment with observations by stabilizing the feedback processes that regulate gas cooling, but this idea has not yet been well tested with cosmological numerical simulations. Here we present cosmological simulations of 10 galaxy clusters performed with five different levels of isotropic Spitzer conduction, which alters both the cores and outskirts of clusters, though not dramatically. In the cores, conduction flattens central temperature gradients, making them nearly isothermal and slightly lowering the central density, but failing to prevent a cooling catastrophe there. Conduction has little effect on temperature gradients outside of cluster cores because outward conductive heat flow tends to inflate the outer parts of the intracluster medium (ICM), instead of raising its temperature. In general, conduction tends reduce temperature inhomogeneity in the ICM, but our simulations indicate that those homogenizing effects would be extremely difficult to observe in ~5 keV clusters. Outside the virial radius, our conduction implementation lowers the gas densities and temperatures because it reduces the Mach numbers of accretion shocks. We conclude that, despite the numerous small ways in which conduction alters the structure of galaxy clusters, none of these effects are significant enough to make the efficiency of conduction easily measurable, unless its effects are more pronounced in clusters hotter than those we have simulated.",

    "abstract": "Direct numerical simulation is used to understand the flow over ripple-shaped random rough elements. The random roughness has been generated using the model for sand ripples consisting of saltation, creep and suspension processes. A set of metrics based on both the geometrical and statistical properties of roughness was derived to characterize random roughness. The eight cases that have been studied with varied asymmetric distribution and \u201cpeakedness\u201d as specified by the skewness and kurtosis of the height distribution varying from 0.28 to 0.7, and from 1.8 to 2.2, respectively. Analogous to \u03bb/h for canonical (regular) roughness, \u03bbavg/hmax was selected as the geometrical parameter to characterize the surface, ranging from 4 to 26. The results have revealed that roughness significantly alters the mean velocity as well as turbulence in the inner layer. The outer layer is relatively unaffected due to the presence of roughness. The results further revealed that roughness distribution that is symmetric and which is well spread out has a stronger influence on the mean flow in the near-wall flow region. Altering the \u03bbavg/hmax affects the skewness and kurtosis of the height distribution, which are the important metrics to quantify the mean flow over a rough wall with random rough elements. The peak turbulence intensities increased with increasing \u03bbavg/hmax, however its effect on rms of the velocity fluctuations was confined to a region very close to the rough wall. Similar to mean flow, a symmetrical and a well-spread roughness distribution resulted in more energetic turbulent structures, stronger near-wall vortices, and increased turbulence activity. A similar trend was observed for the small scale features of the turbulent flow as seen from the vorticity fluctuations. To characterize turbulent flow over random rough surface of given maximum height, the geometrical parameter \u03bbavg/hmax as well as statistical parameters, the skewness and kurtosis are important metrics to be considered.",

    "abstract": "The issue of global climate change is of great interest to scientists and a critical concern of society at large. One important piece of the climate puzzle is how the dynamics of large-scale ice sheets, such as those in Greenland and Antarctica, will react in response to such climate change. Domain scientists have developed several simulation models to predict and understand the behavior of large-scale ice sheets, but the depth of knowledge gained from such models is largely dependent upon the resolution at which they can be efficiently executed. The problem, however, is that relatively small increases in the resolution of the model result in very large increases in the size of the input and output data sets, and an explosion in the number of grid points that must be considered by the simulation. Thus, increasing the resolution of ice-sheet models, in general, requires the use of supercomputing technologies and the application of tools and techniques developed within the high-performance computing research community. In this paper, we discuss our work in evaluating and increasing the performance of the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) [6, 25, 38], using a high-resolution model of the Greenland ice sheet, on a state-of-the-art supercomputer. In particular, we found that the computation performed by PISM was highly scalable, but that the I/O demands of the higherresolution model were a significant drag on overall performance. We then performed a series of experiments to determine the cause of the relatively poor I/O performance and how such performance could be improved. By making simple changes to the PISM source code and one of the I/O libraries used by PISM we were able to provide an 8-fold increase in I/O performance.",

In nanolayers with pristine architectures, plastic dissipation prior to crack nucleation is suppressed due to the high hydrostatic tensile stress state. The presence of sources for microtwinning partials such as micro-cracks or columnar grain boundaries result in abundant deformation twin lamellae across multiple Cu/Ag interlayers. Plastic recovery is observed during unloading of the nanolayers.",

    "abstract": "Lower hybrid (LH) ray propagation in toroidal plasma is shown to be controlled by combination of the azimuthal spectrum launched by the antenna, the poloidal variation of the magnetic field, and the scattering of the waves by the drift wave fluctuations. The width of the poloidal and radial radio frequency wave spectrum increases rapidly as the rays penetrate into higher density and scatter from the drift waves. The electron temperature gradient (ETG) spectrum is particularly effective in scattering the LH waves due to its comparable wavelengths and phase velocities. ETG turbulence is also driven by the radial gradient of the electron current profile giving rise to an anomalous viscosity spreading the LH driven plasma currents. The LH wave scattering is derived from a Fokker-Planck equation for the distribution of the ray trajectories with diffusivities derived from the drift wave fluctuations. The condition for chaotic diffusion for the rays is derived. The evolution of the poloidal and radial mode number spectrum of the lower hybrid waves are both on the antenna spectrum and the spectrum of the drift waves. Antennas launching higher poloidal mode number spectra drive off-axis current density profiles producing negative central shear [RS] plasmas with improved thermal confinement from ETG transport. Core plasma current drive requires antennas with low azimuthal mode spectra peaked at m 1\u20444 0 azimuthal mode numbers.",

    "abstract": "For the last decade, a big deal of attention is being devoted to study inflammatory response upon exposure to multi/single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and different fullerene derivatives. In particular, carbon nanoparticles are reported to provoke substantial inflammation in alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells, epidermal keratinocytes, cultured monocyte-macrophage cells etc. We suggest a hypothetical model providing the potential mechanistic explanation for immune and inflammatory responses observed upon exposure to carbon nanoparticles. Specifically, we performed a theoretical study to analyze CNT and C60 fullerene interactions with the available x-ray structures of Toll-like receptors (TLR) homo- and heterodimer extracellular domains. The assumption was based on the fact, that similar to the known TLR ligands both CNT and fullerene induce, in cells, secretion of certain inflammatory protein mediators, such as interleukins and chemokines. These proteins are observed within inflammation downstream processes resulted from ligand molecule dependent inhibition or activation of TLRs \u2013induced signal transduction. Our computational studies have shown that the internal hydrophobic pockets of some TLRs might be capable to bind small-sized carbon nanostructures (5,5 armchair SWCNT containing 11 carbon atom layers and C60 fullerene). High binding scores and minor structural alterations induced in TLR ectodomains upon binding C60 and CNT further supported our hypothesis. Additionally, the proposed hypothesis is strengthened by the indirect experimental findings indicating that CNTs and fullerene induce an excessive expression of specific cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL-8 and MCP1).",

Compared to the PBE xc functional, the RPA reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) per oxygen from 0.44 to 0.15 eV. The calculated deviations from experiments are separated into two parts: a systematic and uniform error related to the reference energy of O and the errors specific to diffferent oxidation states O^{2\u2212}, O_2^{2\u2212}, and O_2^{\u2212}. Our results show that the RPA improves both the reference energy and the three oxidation states.",

The protein\u2013ligand docking studies and improved structure\u2013activity models have been able both to predict binding affinities for the set of fullerene-C60 derivatives and to help in finding mechanisms of fullerene derivative interactions with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 aspartic protease, HIV-1 PR. Protein\u2013ligand docking revealed several important molecular fragments that are responsible for the interaction with HIV-1 PR. In addition, a density functional theory method has been utilized to identify the optimal geometries and predict physico-chemical parameters of the studied compounds. The 5-variable GA-MLRA based model showed the best predictive ability (r2training = 0.882 and r2test = 0.738), with high internal and external correlation coefficients.",

The deuterium bombardment of monocrystalline tungsten was modeled by molecular dynamics simulation using LAMMPS code and Tersoff type interatomic potential. The deuterium trapping rate, implantation depth, and the stopping time in tungsten at several temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K bombarded by 5\u2013100 eV deuterium atoms were simulated. Deuterium bubble formation at near tungsten surface was also studied. Irradiated monocrystalline tungsten became amorphous state prior to deuterium cluster formation, and gas bubbles were observed in the 600, 900, and 1200 K tungsten samples. The formation of gas bubbles were caused by the near surface deuterium super-saturation region and the subsequent plastic deformation induced by the local high gas pressure.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 helicase couples adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding and hydrolysis to polynucleotide unwinding. Understanding the regulation mechanism of ATP binding will facilitate targeting of the ATP-binding site for potential therapeutic development for hepatitis C. T324, an amino acid residue connecting domains 1 and 2 of NS3 helicase, has been suggested as part of a flexible hinge for opening of the ATP-binding cleft, although the detailed mechanism remains largely unclear. We used computational simulation to examine the mutational effect of T324 on the dynamics of the ATP-binding site. A mutant model, T324A, of the NS3 helicase apo structure was created and energy was minimized. Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for both wild type and the T324A mutant apo structures to compare their differences. For the mutant structure, histogram analysis of pairwise distances between residues in domains 1 and 2 (E291-Q460, K210-R464 and R467-T212) showed that separation between the two domains was reduced by 10% and the standard deviation by 33%. Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis demonstrated that residues in close proximity to residue 324 have at least 30% RMSF value reductions in the mutant structure. Solvent RMSF analysis showed that more water molecules were trapped near D290 and H293 in domain 1 to form an extensive interaction network constraining cleft opening. We also demonstrated that the T324A mutation established a new atomic interaction with V331, revealing that an atomic interaction cascade from T324 to residues in domains 1 and 2 controls the flexibility of the ATP-binding cleft.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical properties of gold clusters, namely, the size dependence of these properties, is necessary for developing wide range of gold clusters\u2019 applications. Having this purpose in mind, the structural and energetic properties, such as binding energies, relative stability and band gaps \u0394E(HL) (HOMO-LUMO gaps) are evaluated. The gold clusters in a wide range of sizes, Aun (n=2 - 2016), were constructed and studied by Density Functional Theory and Extended H\u00fcckel Theory approaches. It was shown that the high values of \u0394E(HL) for the clusters with n= 2, 6, 8, 20 correlate with the highest stability. This finding explains the existence of magic numbers for gold clusters. The 20 atom tetrahedral cluster stands out as particularly stable, comparing to the other small clusters. The binding energy EB is found to increase with the cluster size. The second difference in energy - \u03942E(n) value is used as the criterion of stability, in addition to \u0394E(HL) and also shows a tendency to increase with the cluster size. This behavior suggests a transition of larger clusters towards bulk metallic properties. Both curves - \u03942E(n) and \u0394E(HL) show sharp transformation from high values to close to 0 eV at n=252-504 cluster sizes (it relates to ca 2 nm cluster size).",

    "abstract": "The nonequilibrium stretching of decaalanine in vacuum using steered molecular dynamics and Jarzynski\u2019s relation led to the landmark determination of its potential of mean force by Park and Schulten (Chem. Phys. 2004). In so doing, the relative thermodynamics of the hydrogen-bond contacts and the entropy of the chain were quantified through the reversible work, the potential of mean force (PMF). A recently developed adaptive steered molecular dynamics algorithm (Ozer et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2010) has now made it possible to determine the thermodynamics, PMF, of the stretching of decaalanine in a model solvent of TIP3P water molecules. The loss of internal hydrogen bonds and the formation of hydrogen bonds between the peptide and the solvent has also been tracked with the corresponding stabilization in the PMF. As in the vacuum, most of the thermodynamic penalty to unravel the chain in solvent occurs during the regime when the internal hydrogen bonds are broken. The formation of hydrogen bonds with the solvent provides a significant stabilization not seen in vacuum, reducing the total energy cost to unravel by nearly a factor of 2.",

    "abstract": "We apply a recent proposal for a distinguished ground state of a quantum field in a globally hyperbolic spacetime to the free massless scalar field in a causal diamond in two-dimensional Minkowski space. We investigate the two limits in which the Wightman function is evaluated (i) for pairs of points that lie in the centre of the diamond (i.e. far from the boundaries), and (ii) for pairs of points that are close to the left or right corner. We find that in the centre, the Minkowski vacuum state is recovered, with a definite value of the infrared cutoff. Interestingly, the ground state is not the Rindler vacuum in the corner of the diamond, as might have been expected, but is instead the vacuum of a flat space in the presence of a static mirror on that corner. We confirm these results by numerically evaluating the Wightman function of a massless scalar field on a causal set corresponding to the continuum causal diamond.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) cells are highly invasive, infiltrating into the surrounding normal brain tissue, making it impossible to completely eradicate GBM tumors by surgery or radiation. Increasing evidence also shows that these migratory cells are highly resistant to cytotoxic reagents, but decreasing their migratory capability can re-sensitize them to chemotherapy. These evidences suggest that the migratory cell population may serve as a better therapeutic target for more effective treatment of GBM. In order to understand the regulatory mechanism underlying the motile phenotype, we carried out a genome-wide RNAi screen for genes inhibiting the migration of GBM cells. The screening identified a total of twenty-five primary hits; seven of them were confirmed by secondary screening. Further study showed that three of the genes, FLNA, KHSRP and HCFC1, also functioned in vivo, and knocking them down caused multifocal tumor in a mouse model. Interestingly, two genes, KHSRP and HCFC1, were also found to be correlated with the clinical outcome of GBM patients. These two genes have not been previously associated with cell migration.",

When combined with a spatially adaptive extension the algorithm results in a factor of 10\u20131000 speed-up over the existing forward modeling reconstruction method while preserving most of the spatial and orientation resolution characteristics. Tests of the reconstruction code based on simulated structures and real data on a complex microstructure are presented.

    "abstract": "With the general availability of PetaFLOP clusters and the advent of heterogeneous machines equipped with special accelerator cards such as the Xeon Phi, computer scientist face the difficult task of improving application scalability beyond what is possible with conventional techniques and programming models today. In addition, the need for highly adaptive runtime algorithms and for applications handling highly inhomogeneous data further impedes our ability to efficiently write code which performs and scales well. In this paper we present the advantages of using HPX, a general purpose parallel runtime system for applications of any scale as a backend for LibGeoDecomp for implementing a three-dimensional N-Body simulation with local interactions. We compare scaling and performance results for this application while using the HPX and MPI backends for LibGeoDecomp. LibGeoDecomp is a Library for Geometric Decomposition codes implementing the idea of a user supplied simulation model, where the library handles the spatial and temporal loops, and the data storage. The presented results are acquired from various homogeneous and heterogeneous runs including up to 1024 nodes (16384 conventional cores) combined with up to 16 Xeon Phi accelerators (3856 hardware threads) on TACC\u2019s Stampede supercomputer. In the configuration using the HPX backend, more than 0.35 PFLOPS have been achieved, which corresponds to a parallel application efficiency of around 79%. Our measurements demonstrate the advantage of using the intrinsically asynchronous and message driven programming model exposed by HPX which enables better latency hiding, fine to medium grain parallelism, and constraint based synchronization. HPX\u2019s uniform programming model simplifies writing highly parallel code for heterogeneous resources.",

    "abstract": "Protein folding kinetics is commonly monitored by changes in tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence intensity. Considerable recent discussion has centered on whether the fluorescence of the single Trp in the much-studied, fast-folding villin headpiece C-terminal domain (HP35) accurately reflects folding kinetics, given the general view that quenching is by a histidine cation (His(+)) one turn away in an alpha-helix (helix III) that forms early in the folding process, according to published MD simulations. To help answer this question, we ran 1.0 mu s MD simulations on HP35 (N27H) and a faster-folding variant in its folded form at 300 K and used the coordinates and force field charges with quantum calculations to simulate fluorescence quenching caused by electron transfer to the local amide and to the His(+). The simulations demonstrate that quenching by His(+) in the fully formed helix III is possible only during certain Trp and His(+) rotamer and solvent conformations, the propensity of which is a variable that can allow Trp fluorescence to report the global folding rate, as recent experiments imply.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a significant level of discussion of the correct treatment of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in the astrophysical community. This discussion relies largely on how the KHI test is posed and analyzed. We pose a stringent test of the initial growth of the instability. The goal is to provide a rigorous methodology for verifying a code on two-dimensional KHI. We ran the problem in the Pencil Code, Athena, Enzo, NDSPMHD, and Phurbas. A strict comparison, judgment, or ranking, between codes is beyond the scope of this work, though this work provides the mathematical framework needed for such a study. Nonetheless, how the test is posed circumvents the issues raised by tests starting from a sharp contact discontinuity yet it still shows the poor performance of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We then comment on the connection between this behavior to the underlying lack of zeroth-order consistency in SPH interpolation. We comment on the tendency of some methods, particularly those with very low numerical diffusion, to produce secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz billows on similar tests. Though the lack of a fixed, physical diffusive scale in the Euler equations lies at the root of the issue, we suggest that in some methods an extra diffusion operator should be used to damp the growth of instabilities arising from grid noise. This statement applies particularly to moving-mesh tessellation codes, but also to fixed-grid Godunov schemes.",

    "abstract": "A protocol is presented and used for the computation of physicochemical properties of nitroaromatic energetic compounds (ECs) using molecular simulation. Solvation and self-solvation free energies of ECs are computed using an expanded ensemble (EE) molecular dynamics method, with the TraPPE-UA/CHELPG and CGenFF/CHELPG force field models. Thermodynamic pathways relating Gibbs free energies and physicochemical properties are used to predict the room temperature vapor pressures, solubilities (in water and 1-octanol), Henry\u2019s law constants, and partition coefficients (octanol\u2013water, air\u2013water, and air\u2013octanol) for liquid, subcooled, and solid ECs from the molecular simulations. These predictions are compared to experimental data where available. It is found that the use of the TraPPE-UA model with CHELPG charges computed here leads to predictions of measured physicochemical properties of comparable accuracy to that of other theoretical and empirical models. However, the advantage of the method used here is that with no experimental data, unlike other methods, a number of physicochemical properties for a compound can be calculated from only its atomic connectivity, charges obtained from density function theory (DFT), and choice of force field using two simulations: its self-solvation free energy and its Gibbs free energy in a solvent.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of fine particle emission from combustion sources is important to understand their health effects, and to develop emissions regulations. Dilution sampling is the most commonly used technique to measure particle number distribution because it simulates the mixing and cooling of combustion exhaust with atmospheric air, which drives nucleation and condensation of semi volatile material. Experiments suggest that the measured size distribution is dependent on the dilution ratio used and the tunnel design. In the present work, computational analysis using a large-eddy-simulation (LES) based model is performed to investigate the effect of tunnel flow and geometric parameters on H2SO4-H2O binary nucleation inside dilution tunnels. Model predictions suggest that the experimental trends are likely due to differences in the intensity of turbulent mixing inside the tunnels. It is found that the interaction of dilution air and combustion exhaust in the mixing layer greatly impacts the extent of nucleation. In general, a cross-flow interaction with enhanced turbulent mixing leads to greater number of nucleation-mode particles than an axial-flow interaction of combustion sample and dilution air.",

    "abstract": "Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are used as energetic materials, reagents, and pesticides; however, they are potentially hazardous for the environment and human health. To predict the environmental distribution of these compounds, the vapor pressure, aqueous solubility, and Henry\u2019s law constant are important properties, as is the solvation free energy in water from which the latter two can be computed. Here, we have calculated the hydration free energies for a set of nine nitroaromatic compounds containing one, two, and three nitro groups using the expanded ensemble molecular dynamics simulation method with TIP3P water and the GAFF, CGenFF, OPLS-AA, and TraPPE force field parameters and the RESP (gas phase), CHELPG (gas phase), and CM4 (aqueous phase) partial atomic charges calculated here. Also, we have computed hydration free energies using the reported default partial atomic charges of the OPLS-AA force field and using the semiempirical AM1-BCC charges with GAFF parameters. The effect of water model flexibility on the computation of hydration free energy is examined with CGenFF/(CHELPG+SPC-Fw) model. All the force fields studied generally led to less accurate predictions with increasing numbers of nitro groups. The average unsigned errors (AUE) show that 6 of 16 force-field/(charge+water) models used perform approximately equally well in predicting measured hydration free energies: these are CGenFF/(CHELPG+TIP3P), CGenFF/(CM4+TIP3P), OPLS-AA/(CHELPG+TIP3P), OPLS-AA/(CM4+TIP3P), TraPPE-UA/(CHELPG+TIP3P), and TraPPE-UA/(CM4+TIP3P). When using the default atomic charges, the OPLS-AA force field was the most accurate, though using CHELPG and CM4 charges led to better predictions. Our analyses indicate that not only the charges but also the van der Waals interaction parameters for the nitro-group nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the force fields are partly responsible for the performance variations in predicting solvation free energies. We also compared the force field-based simulation results with the predictions from the SM6 solvation model and Abraham linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) method. With an appropriate choice of theory and basis set both for geometry optimization and computation, which unfortunately is not known a priori, the SM6 model hydration free energy predictions for the NACs are comparable to the simulation results here. The Abraham LSER predictions with descriptors obtained from the Platts method are of reasonable accuracy. A useful addition to this paper is the Supporting Information that contains a compiled and evaluated list of the hydration free energies of the NACs studied here assembled from the literature.",

    "abstract": "Molecular Dynamics simulations of heat conduction in liquid Argon confined in Silver nano-channels are performed subject to three different thermal conditions. Particularly, different surface temperatures are imposed on Silver domains using a thermostat in all and limited number of solid layers, resulting in heat flux in the liquid domain. Alternatively, energy is injected and extracted from solid layers to create a NVE liquid Argon system, which corresponds to heat flux specification. Imposition of a constant temperature region in the solid domain results in an unphysical temperature jump, indicating the presence of an artificial thermal resistance induced by the thermostat. Thermal resistance analyses for the components of each case are performed to distinguish the artificial and interface thermal resistance effects. Constant wall temperature simulations are shown to exhibit superposition of the artificial and interface thermal resistance values at the liquid/solid interface, while applying thermostat on wall layers sufficiently away from the liquid/solid interface results in consistent predictions of the interface thermal resistance. Injecting and extracting energy from each solid layer eliminates the artificial resistance. However, the method cannot directly specify a desired temperature difference between the two solid domains.",

    "abstract": "One approach to understanding the genetic basis of speciation is to scan the genomes of recently diverged taxa to identify highly differentiated regions. The house mouse, Mus musculus, provides a useful system for the study of speciation. Three subspecies (M. m. castaneus, M. m. domesticus, and M. m. musculus) diverged ~350 KYA, are distributed parapatrically, show varying degrees of reproductive isolation in laboratory crosses, and hybridize in nature. We sequenced the testes transcriptomes of multiple wild-derived inbred lines from each subspecies to identify highly differentiated regions of the genome, to identify genes showing high expression divergence, and to compare patterns of differentiation among subspecies that have different demographic histories and exhibit different levels of reproductive isolation. Using a sliding-window approach, we found many genomic regions with high levels of sequence differentiation in each of the pairwise comparisons among subspecies. In all comparisons, the X chromosome was more highly differentiated than the autosomes. Sequence differentiation and expression divergence were greater in the M. m. domesticus - M. m. musculus comparison than in either pairwise comparison with M. m. castaneus, consistent with laboratory crosses which show greatest reproductive isolation between M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus. Coalescent simulations suggest that differences in estimates of effective population size can account for many of the observed patterns. However, there was an excess of highly differentiated regions relative to simulated distributions under a wide range of demographic scenarios. Overlap of some highly differentiated regions with previous results from QTL mapping and hybrid zone studies points to promising candidate regions for reproductive isolation.",

    "abstract": "Robust characterization of seismic performance requires the quantification and propagation of various sources of uncertainties throughout the analysis and assessment. This paper presents recent research to characterize and evaluate the effect of structural modeling uncertainties, along with ground motion and hazard uncertainties, on the collapse safety of buildings. The focus of the study is on modern reinforced concrete frame buildings, but the proposed methods and findings are generally applicable to other structural materials and systems. Uncertainties and correlations in structural component model parameters are evaluated by applying random effects regression models to a database of tests on reinforced concrete beam-columns. These analyses show that model parameters within structural components tend to be uncorrelated, whereas the data suggest that there are strong correlations between like parameters of different components within a building. The influence of modeling uncertainties on the collapse behavior of the systems is evaluated using several alternative methods, including Monte Carlo simulations, First- Order Second-Moment, response surface and artificial neural network methods. Collapse risk estimates are used to illustrate the relative merits of each method, depending on the size and other characteristics of the problem. Simulation-based methods are explored in terms of the computational effort involved in uncertainty propagation in the presence of high dimensional random variables for collapse safety assessments. The results emphasize the sensitivity of collapse response to modeling uncertainties and the challenges of balancing of computational efficiency and robust uncertainty characterization.",

As we enter an era of larger and larger data sets, the need to monitor, track, and analyze users' consumption of storage resources becomes more critical for planning, operating, and managing petascale storage environments. NCAR's Computational and Information Systems Laboratory has long had a formal accounting mechanism in place for its archival storage system and has recently extended a similar mechanism to its recently acquired 11-PB disk resource. The collected data helps both NCAR's users and administrators by supporting reports and analyses to guide the use and management of these vital resources.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the origin of Larson's scaling laws describing the structure and kinematics of molecular clouds. Our analysis is based on recent observational measurements and data from a suite of six simulations of the interstellar medium, including effects of self-gravity, turbulence, magnetic field, and multiphase thermodynamics. Simulations of isothermal supersonic turbulence reproduce observed slopes in linewidth-size and mass-size relations. Whether or not self-gravity is included, the linewidth-size relation remains the same. The mass-size relation, instead, substantially flattens below the sonic scale, as prestellar cores start to form. Our multiphase models with magnetic field and domain size 200 pc reproduce both scaling and normalization of the first Larson law. The simulations support a turbulent interpretation of Larson's relations. This interpretation implies that: (i) the slopes of linewidth-size and mass-size correlations are determined by the inertial cascade; (ii) none of the three Larson laws is fundamental; (iii) instead, if one is known, the other two follow from scale invariance of the kinetic energy transfer rate. It does not imply that gravity is dynamically unimportant. The self-similarity of structure established by the turbulence breaks in star-forming clouds due to the development of gravitational instability in the vicinity of the sonic scale. The instability leads to the formation of prestellar cores with the characteristic mass set by the sonic scale. The high-end slope of the core mass function predicted by the scaling relations is consistent with the Salpeter power-law index.",

    "abstract": "Oxidation behavior of the two-phase Nb/Nb5Si3 composite is of significant importance for the potential applications of the composite at high-temperature conditions. We investigate the atomic-scale oxidation mechanism of the Nb/Nb5Si3 composite with first-principles density-functional theory and thermodynamics analysis. In particular, the effects of energetics, thermodynamics, segregation, and interfaces are identified. The clean composite surface is found to be composed of both Nb(110) and Si-terminated Nb5Si3(001). Energetics and thermodynamics calculations show that, during the oxidation process, the Nb(110) surface is oxidized first, followed by the segregation of niobium of the Nb5Si3(001) surface and subsequent oxidation of the Nb element of Nb5Si3. High coverage of oxygen results in dissolved oxygen in bulk Nb through the diffusion of oxygen in the surface and at the interface. The theoretical investigation also provides an explanation, at the atomic-scale, for the experimental observation that the oxidation layer is essentially composed of niobium oxide and almost free of silicon. Furthermore, the methodology of this work can be applied to investigations of the oxidation behavior of other two-phase and multi-phase composites.",

    "abstract": "We perform three-dimensional (3-D) numerical calculations of dynamic rupture along non-planar faults to study the effects of fault roughness on rupture propagation and resultant ground motion. The fault roughness model follows a self-similar fractal distribution over length scales spanning three orders of magnitude, from ~102 to ~105 m. The fault is governed by a strongly rate-weakening friction, and the bulk material is subject to Drucker-Prager viscoplasticity. Fault roughness promotes the development of self-healing rupture pulses and a heterogeneous distribution of fault slip at the free surface and at depth. The inelastic deformation, generated by the large dynamic stress near rupture fronts, occurs in a narrow volume around the fault with heterogeneous thickness correlated to local roughness slopes. Inelastic deformation near the free surface, however, is induced by the stress waves originated from dynamic rupture at depth and spreads to large distances (>10 km) away from the fault. The present simulations model seismic wave excitation up to ~10 Hz with rupture lengths of ~100 km, permitting comparisons with empirical studies of ground-motion intensity measures of engineering interest. Characteristics of site-averaged synthetic response spectra, including the distance and period dependence of the median values, absolute level, and intra-event standard deviation, are comparable to appropriate empirical estimates throughout the period range 0.1\u20133.0 s. This class of model may provide a viable representation of the ground-motion excitation process over a wide frequency range in a large spatial domain, with potential applications to the numerical prediction of source- and path-specific effects on earthquake ground motion.",

    "abstract": "Electric fields map from the magnetosphere to the E region ionosphere where they drive the intense currents of the auroral electrojet. Particularly during geomagnetic storms and substorms, these currents become sufficiently intense to develop Farley-Buneman (FB) streaming instabilities and become turbulent. This leads to anomalous electron heating which can raise the electron temperature from 300 K to as much as 4000 K and, also, modifies auroral conductivities. This paper describes the first fully kinetic 3-D simulations of electric field-driven turbulence in the electrojet and compares the results with 2-D simulations and observations. These simulations show that 3-D turbulence can dramatically elevate electron temperatures, enough to explain the observed heating. They also show the saturated amplitude of the waves; coupling between linearly growing modes and damped modes; the propagation of the dominant modes at phase velocities near the acoustic velocity, slower than in 2-D simulations; and anomalous cross-field electron transport, leading to a greatly increased E region Pedersen conductivity. These simulations provide information useful in accurately modeling FB turbulence and represent significant progress in understanding the electrojet.",

    "abstract": "One of the consequences of entering the era of precision cosmology is the widespread adoption of photometric redshift probability density functions (PDFs). Both current and future photometric surveys are expected to obtain images of billions of distinct galaxies. As a result, storing and analysing all of these PDFs will be non-trivial and even more severe if a survey plans to compute and store multiple different PDFs. In this paper we propose the use of a sparse basis representation to fully represent individual photo-z PDFs. By using an orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm and a combination of Gaussian and Voigt basis functions, we demonstrate how our approach is superior to a multi-Gaussian fitting, as we require approximately half of the parameters for the same fitting accuracy with the additional advantage that an entire PDF can be stored by using a 4-byte integer per basis function, and we can achieve better accuracy by increasing the number of bases. By using data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey, we demonstrate that only 10-20 points per galaxy are sufficient to reconstruct both the individual PDFs and the ensemble redshift distribution, N(z), to an accuracy of 99.9 per cent when compared to the one built using the original PDFs computed with a resolution of \u03b4z = 0.01, reducing the required storage of 200 original values by a factor of 10-20. Finally, we demonstrate how this basis representation can be directly extended to a cosmological analysis, thereby increasing computational performance without losing resolution nor accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of CO2 and CH4 sorption and separation were performed in dia-7i-1-Co, a metal\u2013organic material (MOM) consisting of a 7-fold interpenetrated net of Co2+ ions coordinated to 4-(2-(4-pyridyl)ethenyl)benzoate linkers. This MOM shows high affinity toward CH4 at low loading due to the presence of narrow, close fitting, one-dimensional hydrophobic channels\u2014this makes the MOM relevant for applications in low-pressure methane storage. The calculated CO2 and CH4 sorption isotherms and isosteric heat of adsorption, Qst, values in dia-7i-1-Co are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental results for all state points considered. The experimental initial Qst value for CH4 in dia-7i-1-Co is currently the highest of reported MOM materials, and this was further validated by the simulations performed herein. The simulations predict relatively constant Qst values for CO2 and CH4 sorption across all loadings in dia-7i-1-Co, consistent with the one type of binding site identified for the respective sorbate molecules in this MOM. Examination of the three-dimensional histogram showing the sites of CO2 and CH4 sorption in dia-7i-1-Co confirmed this finding. Inspection of the modeled structure revealed that the sorbate molecules form a strong interaction with the organic linkers within the constricted hydrophobic channels. Ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations and GCMC binary mixture simulations predict that the selectivity of CO2 over CH4 in dia-7i-1-Co is quite low, which is a direct consequence of the MOM\u2019s high affinity toward both CO2 and CH4 as well as the nonspecific mechanism shown here. This study provides theoretical insights into the effects of pore size on CO2 and CH4 sorption in porous MOMs and its effect upon selectivity, including postulating design strategies to distinguish between sorbates of similar size and hydrophobicity.",

    "abstract": "Insect wings usually are flexible and deform significantly under the combined inertial and aerodynamic load. To study the effect of wing flexibility on both lift and thrust production in forward flight, a two-dimensional numerical simulation is employed to compute the fluid\u2013structure interaction of an elastic wing section translating in an inclined stroke plane while pitching around its leading ledge. The effects of the wing stiffness, mass ratio, stroke plane angle, and flight speed are considered. The results show that the passive pitching due to wing deformation can significantly increase thrust while either maintaining lift at the same level or increasing it simultaneously. Another important finding is that even though the wing structure and actuation kinematics are symmetric, chordwise deformation of the wing shows a larger magnitude during upstroke than during downstroke. The asymmetry is more pronounced when the wing has a low mass ratio so that the fluid-induced deformation is significant. Such an aerodynamic cause may serve as an additional mechanism for the asymmetric deformation pattern observed in real insects.",

It is found that for the rigid plate and the flexible plate with the first-mode deformation, the thrust coefficient nearly collapses onto the same curve when plotted against the Strouhal number that is defined using the tail excursion. Exceptions are found when the plate is overly flexible and higher deformation modes take place. On the other hand, the flexible plate has significantly higher power efficiency than the rigid plate at the same Strouhal number. Like the rigid plate, wake transition is observed for the flexible plate as the Strouhal number is varied. Specifically, at low Strouhal numbers (St  0.28), the wake turns into two trains of closed vortex rings with hairpin legs.",

    "abstract": "We determine the liquid-solid phase diagram for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-selenium plasma mixtures using two-phase molecular dynamics simulations. We identify liquid, solid, and interface regions using a bond angle metric. To study finite-size effects, we perform 27 648- and 55 296-ion simulations. To help monitor nonequilibrium effects, we calculate diffusion constants Di. For the carbon-oxygen system we find that DO for oxygen ions in the solid is much smaller than DC for carbon ions and that both diffusion constants are 80 or more times smaller than diffusion constants in the liquid phase. There is excellent agreement between our carbon-oxygen phase diagram and that predicted by Medin and Cumming. This suggests that errors from finite-size and nonequilibrium effects are small and that the carbon-oxygen phase diagram is now accurately known. The oxygen-selenium system is a simple two-component model for more complex rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis ash compositions for an accreting neutron star. Diffusion of oxygen, in a predominantly selenium crystal, is remarkably fast, comparable to diffusion in the liquid phase. We find a somewhat lower melting temperature for the oxygen-selenium system than that predicted by Medin and Cumming. This is probably because of electron screening effects.",

The three-dimensional (3D) simulation is performed by using an immersed-boundary method coupled with a nonlinear finite element method. The global stability, bistability and instability are identified in the 3D simulations. The Squire's theorem is extended to analyze the stability of the fluid-flag system with 3D initial perturbations. It is found that if a parallel flow around the flag admits an unstable 3D disturbance for a certain value of the flutter speed, then a two-dimensional (2D) disturbance at a lower flutter speed is also admitted. In addition, the growth rate of 2D disturbance is larger than that of the 3D disturbance.",

    "abstract": "In order to study the role of the passive deformation in the aerodynamics of insect wings, we computationally model the three-dimensional fluid\u2013structure interaction of an elastic rectangular wing at a low aspect ratio during hovering flight. The code couples a viscous incompressible flow solver based on the immersed-boundary method and a nonlinear finite-element solver for thin-walled structures. During a flapping stroke, the wing surface is dominated by non-uniform chordwise deformations. The effects of the wing stiffness, mass ratio, phase angle of active pitching, and Reynolds number are investigated. The results show that both the phase and the rate of passive pitching due to the wing flexibility can significantly modify the aerodynamics of the wing. The dynamic pitching depends not only on the specified kinematics at the wing root and the stiffness of the wing, but also greatly on the mass ratio, which represents the relative importance of the wing inertia and aerodynamic forces in the wing deformation. We use the ratio between the flapping frequency, $\\omega $, and natural frequency of the wing, ${\\omega }_{n} $, as the non-dimensional stiffness. In general, when $\\omega / {\\omega }_{n} \\leq 0. 3$, the deformation significantly enhances the lift and also improves the lift efficiency despite a disadvantageous camber. In particular, when the inertial pitching torque is assisted by an aerodynamic torque of comparable magnitude, the lift efficiency can be markedly improved.",

    "abstract": "Microfluidic channels with asymmetric protrusions have been utilized previously to enhance mixing in the drops that travel through the channels. To study the flow pattern in the drops and help explain the mixing phenomenon, in this work an immersed-boundary method is developed to simulate dynamics of a drop in arbitrary channel geometries. In this method, the fluid\u2013solid interface is handled by the sharp-interface approach in which the interface maintains its singularity and the boundary conditions are satisfied at the exact location of the interface. On the other hand, the fluid\u2013fluid interface is handled by a diffuse-interface approach in which the interfacial discontinuities are regularized by an approximated delta function. The simulation results show that for the drop in a channel with bumps on one side, the flow pattern inside the drop largely depends on the viscosity ratio and the geometry of the bumps. When the viscosity ratio or the curvature of the bumps is increased, the vortex pair inside the drop become skewed or even reduce to one single circulation. In three dimensions, the circulations in the spanwise direction are also developed. The mixing enhancement of these flow patterns is demonstrated by simulating the passive tracers in the drop.",

    "abstract": "Vortex-induced vibration of thin structures attached with piezoelectric materials has recently been explored for its potential application in energy harvesting from a flow. In this work, we numerically simulate the hydrodynamic interaction of two elastic sheets in tandem arrangement, and we study the mechanism of system resonance, at which both sheets are excited and experience greatly increased oscillations as compared to the single sheet with identical properties. The sheets are mounted obliquely to the flow to facilitate vortex shedding. The separation distance between the sheets is systematically varied, and the resonance is found within a range that depends on the mass ratio of the sheets. In contrast with two elastically mounted cylinders oscillating in the transverse direction and experiencing a similar group behavior, the resonance occurs in the present study even when the free stream does not directly impinge on the rear sheet. Further study shows that the resonance is caused by the vortex-vortex and vortex-sheet interactions that adjust the oscillation frequency and modify the magnitude/phase-shift of the hydrodynamic force on the sheets. Implication of the study on multiple sheets in tandem arrangement is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is a monogenic autosomal-recessive disorder of copper accumulation that leads to liver failure and/or neurological deficits. WD is caused by mutations in ATP7B, a transporter that loads Cu(I) onto newly synthesized cupro-enzymes in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and exports excess copper out of cells by trafficking from the TGN to the plasma membrane. To date, most WD mutations have been shown to disrupt ATP7B activity and/or stability. Using a multidisciplinary approach, including clinical analysis of patients, cell-based assays, and computational studies, we characterized a patient mutation, ATP7B(S653Y), which is stable, does not disrupt Cu(I) transport, yet renders the protein unable to exit the TGN. Bulky or charged substitutions at position 653 mimic the phenotype of the patient mutation. Molecular modeling and dynamic simulation suggest that the S653Y mutation induces local distortions within the transmembrane (TM) domain 1 and alter TM1 interaction with TM2. S653Y abolishes the trafficking-stimulating effects of a secondary mutation in the N-terminal apical targeting domain. This result indicates a role for TM1/TM2 in regulating conformations of cytosolic domains involved in ATP7B trafficking. Taken together, our experiments revealed an unexpected role for TM1/TM2 in copper-regulated trafficking of ATP7B and defined a unique class of WD mutants that are transport-competent but trafficking-defective. Understanding the precise consequences of WD-causing mutations will facilitate the development of advanced mutation-specific therapies.",

    "abstract": "Gas and ion transport in the capillary-skimmer subatmospheric interface of a mass spectrometer, which is typically utilized to separate unevaporated micro-droplets from ions, was studied numerically using a two-step approach spanning multiple gas dynamic regimes. The gas flow in the heated capillary and in the interface was determined by solving numerically the Navier-Stokes equation. The capillary-to-skimmer gas/ion flow was modeled through the solution of the full Boltzmann equation with a force term. The force term, together with calculated aerodynamic drag, determined the ion motion in the gap between the capillary and skimmer. Three-dimensional modeling of the impact of the voltage applied to the Einzel lens on the transmission of doubly charged peptide ions through the skimmer orifice was compared with experimental data obtained in the companion study. Good agreement between measured and computed signals was observed. The numerical results indicate that as many as 75% of the ions that exit from the capillary are lost on the conical surface of the skimmer or capillary outer surface because of the electrostatic force and plume divergence.",

At the core it involves supporting the execution of high-throughput workloads of high-performance biomolecular simulations on one or more XSEDE machines. Although conceptually simple, it is still a difficult practical problem to solve, especially in a flexible, robust, scalable manner. Specifically, we employ BigJob{ an interoperable Pilot-Job. The bulk of this paper is about our experience in executing a very large number of ensembles including the associated non-trivial data management problem. Our experience suggests that although a nascent and fledgling technology, BigJob provides a flexible and scalable Pilot-Job to support workloads that were hitherto not easy.",

    "abstract": "The fidelity of integration of pre- and postsynaptic activity by NMDA receptors (NMDARs) requires a match between agonist binding and ion channel opening. To address how agonist binding is transduced into pore opening in NMDARs, we manipulated the coupling between the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and the ion channel by inserting residues in a linker between them. We found that a single residue insertion markedly attenuated the ability of NMDARs to convert a glutamate transient into a functional response. This was largely a result of a decreased likelihood of the channel opening and remaining open. Computational and thermodynamic analyses suggest that insertions prevent the agonist-bound LBD from effectively pulling on pore lining elements, thereby destabilizing pore opening. Furthermore, this pulling energy was more prominent in the GluN2 subunit. We conclude that an efficient NMDAR-mediated synaptic response relies on a mechanical coupling between the LBD and the ion channel.",

    "abstract": "The combinatorial assembly of protein complexes is at the heart of chromatin biology. Lysine demethylase LSD1(KDM1A)/CoREST beautifully exemplifies this concept. The active site of the enzyme tightly associates to the N-terminal domain of transcription factors of the SNAIL1 family, which therefore can competitively inhibit the binding of the N-terminal tail of the histone substrate. Our enzymatic, crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational studies reveal that LSD1/CoREST can bind to a hexapeptide derived from the SNAIL sequence through recognition of a positively charged \u03b1-helical turn that forms upon binding to the enzyme. Variations in sequence and length of this six amino acid ligand modulate affinities enabling the same binding site to differentially interact with proteins that exert distinct biological functions. The discovered short peptide inhibitors exhibit antiproliferative activities and lay the foundation for the development of peptidomimetic small molecule inhibitors of LSD1.",

    "abstract": "Electrical current flow within populations of neurons is a fundamental constituent of brain function. The resulting fluctuating magnetic fields may be sampled noninvasively with an array of magnetic field detectors positioned outside the head. This is magnetoencephalography (MEG). Each source may be characterized by 5-6 parameters, the xyz location and the xyz direction. The magnetic field measurements are nonlinear in the location parameters; hence the source location is identifiable only via search of the brain volume. When there is one or a very few sources, this may be practical; solutions for the general problem have poor resolution and are readily defeated. Referee consensus is a novel cost function which enables identification of a source at one location at a time regardless of the number and location of other sources. This \u201cindependence\u201d enables solution of the general problem and insures suitability to grid computing. The computation scales linearly with the number of nonlinear parameters. Since the method is not readily disrupted by noise or the presence of multiple unknown source, it is applicable to single trial data. MEG recordings were obtained from 26 volunteers while they performed a cognitive task The single trial recordings were processed on the Open Science Grid (\u2248300 CPU hours/sec of data) On average 500+ active sources were found throughout. Statistical analyses demonstrated 1-2 mm resolving power and high confidence findings (p",
