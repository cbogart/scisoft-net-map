## Description
This Scientific Software Network Map viewer is part of an NSF-funded project (SciSIP: The Scientific Software Network Map) to map out the dependencies among scientific software packages. The goal is to help scientists monitor how the software they write is being used, so that they can focus updates and improvements on the most needed areas, understand more deeply how they are being used together, and to take credit for their contributions by being able to document how much their software is being used.
